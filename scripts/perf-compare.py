"""RR-0117b — regression detection thresholds.

Compares a MEASURED perf JSON (the line `scripts/perf-baseline.sh` prints, plus
whatever else the caller merges in, e.g. `binary_bytes`) against the committed
baseline in `docs/perf-baseline.json`, and exits non-zero on a breach.

Design rules this file is built to, each one there because the alternative is
a gate that cannot fail:

* **Thresholds are stated, per metric, in `THRESHOLDS` below** — not inferred,
  not tuned to make a run green. Every number here traces to the plan's
  RR-0117b line: latency p95 +10%, RSS +20%, binary size +20%.
* **A breach prints the measured number, the baseline number, the delta and
  the threshold.** "Regression detected" without the numbers is a message that
  sends someone to re-measure by hand.
* **A metric present in the measurement but absent from the baseline is
  RECORDED, NOT GATED, and says so.** Gating against a baseline that does not
  exist would either fail every first run or silently pass everything; both
  are worse than an explicit "no baseline: recording only" line. This is the
  honest state for CI-linux numbers whose baseline was measured on a
  developer's macOS box — a cross-platform comparison is not a regression
  signal, it is noise with a p-value.
* **A metric in the BASELINE but missing from the MEASUREMENT is a failure**,
  not a pass. A gate silently skipping the metric it was written for is the
  purest form of theatre: the harness stops emitting `board_avg_ms`, the gate
  goes green forever, and nobody learns anything.

Usage:
    perf-compare.py --measured measured.json [--baseline docs/perf-baseline.json]
                    [--record-missing] [--json-out report.json]

Exit codes: 0 all good · 1 threshold breach · 2 bad input / missing metric.

# `worst_ms` is the tail proxy. The plan says "p95"; the harness
# (scripts/perf-baseline.sh) takes 5 samples and reports avg + worst, and a
# p95 computed from 5 samples is not a p95 — it is the max with a misleading
# name. So the gate applies the tail threshold to the number that actually
# exists and says which one it used. Replacing this with a real percentile is
# RR-0117g's job; until then the gate is honest about what it measured.
