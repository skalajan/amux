# RR-0116 / RR-0117a — resource-leak probe (FD + RSS under sustained load).
#
# Boots the Rust server against a THROWAWAY database, drives it with a request
# loop, and samples RSS and open file descriptors on a fixed cadence. Fails if
# either grows past its threshold measured FROM THE POST-WARMUP BASELINE, not
# from process start — a server legitimately grows while it warms caches and
# fills pools, and gating on that produces a detector that fires on healthy
# startup (ethos rule 7: "a threshold below the baseline is not a detector").
#
# WHAT THE PLAN ASKS FOR VS WHAT A HOSTED RUNNER CAN DO, stated rather than
# quietly substituted: RR-0116 asks for a 4h leak test and RR-0117a for 48h.
# GitHub-hosted runners cap a job at 6 hours, so 48h is not runnable there at
# all and 4h eats most of the cap. SOAK_MINUTES is therefore a parameter, the
# nightly runs a short one, and the weekly soak runs the long one; anything
# beyond 6h needs a self-hosted runner and is NOT silently pretended to have
# happened.
#
#   SOAK_MINUTES=30 scripts/soak-probe.sh
#
# Env:
#   SOAK_MINUTES     how long to drive (default 5)
#   SOAK_SAMPLE_S    seconds between samples (default 15)
#   SOAK_RSS_GROWTH  max fractional RSS growth from post-warmup (default 0.20)
#   SOAK_FD_GROWTH   max ABSOLUTE fd growth from post-warmup (default 50)
#   SOAK_CONCURRENCY parallel request loops (default 4)
#   AMUX_LIVE_DB     if set and readable, a READ-ONLY .backup copy is soaked
#                    against instead of an empty DB (real data volume)
