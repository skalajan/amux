# RR-0116 / RR-0117b — the CI-runnable perf measurement.
#
# `scripts/perf-baseline.sh` measures against a copy of the LIVE database,
# which exists on Ethan's machine and nowhere else. CI has no such file, so
# this wrapper:
#
#   1. SEEDS a synthetic database at the plan's stated scale (RR-0110 asks for
#      "FTS5 over 10k entities returns < 50ms", so 10k is the floor, not a
#      round number picked for convenience),
#   2. runs the EXISTING perf-baseline.sh against it — the measurement harness
#      is not duplicated, only fed,
#   3. adds the two metrics that harness does not emit and RR-0117b gates:
#      `search_avg_ms` and `binary_bytes`,
#   4. prints one merged JSON object for scripts/perf-compare.py.
#
# A synthetic corpus is NOT the same signal as the 640k-row live DB, and the
# emitted JSON says so in `_corpus` so a number from here is never mistaken for
# a number from there. Cross-corpus comparison is the reason the CI-measured
# metrics start life in perf-compare.py's "recording only" bucket rather than
# gating on a baseline that was measured somewhere else.
