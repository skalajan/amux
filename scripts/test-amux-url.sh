# AMUX-3046 — `amux url` resolves the canonical amux base past a STALE $AMUX_URL.
#
# A lane started before a port move (8822 retired 2026-08-11, the compat bind
# then dropped) carries the dead address in its PROCESS env for its whole life —
# env cannot be re-read live — so `curl $AMUX_URL/...` fails at connect and reads
# as "server down". `amux url` reads the server-written ~/.amux/endpoint.json,
# which self-updates every boot, so `$(amux url)` survives the NEXT port move too.
#
# These pin the three fail-to-stale traps from the resolver spec, PLUS the
# discriminating case rule 7 demands: a resolver that ALWAYS returns :8824 would
# pass (a)-(e) while being broken — case (f) proves a live, non-retired env is
# actually honoured, so the tests can tell a real resolver from `echo :8824`.
#
# Runs the REAL dispatch path as a subprocess with HOME + $AMUX_URL controlled,
# so it exercises the shipped `url)` case, not a paraphrase of it.
