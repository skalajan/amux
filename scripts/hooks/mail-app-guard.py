"""PreToolUse Bash guard: amux email is the amux API ONLY, never Mail.app.

Ethan, 2026-08-13: "make sure amux is never using mail.app — it should
exclusively be using the amux api to send/read, etc. emails."

WHY THIS EXISTS. The amux server's email API (`$AMUX_URL/api/email/*`) is already
Mail.app-free: it uses the Gmail API for connected accounts and REFUSES the
AppleScript path (`applescript_not_ported`, a 501) for anything else. So the
only way a Mail.app email happens on this box is an agent HAND-ROLLING
`osascript -e 'tell application "Mail" ...'` in a Bash command, bypassing the
API. That is bad in three concrete ways, each of which has bitten:
  - Mail.app sends from the machine's DEFAULT account — Ethan's PERSONAL one —
    not the intended `from` (GE-617, 2026-08-13: a customer reply went out under
    his personal address, recorded "Reply sent via Mail.app").
  - It bypasses the amux send-audit ledger (`/api/email/log`), so the send is
    invisible to attribution.
  - A hand-rolled `set content` reply silently sends a BLANK email
    (`feedback_email_reliability`).
The CLAUDE.md policy already forbids this, but a policy an agent can ignore is
not "make sure". This hook is the enforcement: the command is BLOCKED and the
agent is routed to the sanctioned API.

PRECISION. Blocks only a Bash command that BOTH invokes `osascript` AND targets
`application "Mail"` — so the iMessage owner-alert osascript (application
"Messages"), the iTerm2 automation (application "iTerm2"), and a mere grep/echo
that mentions the string (no osascript) are all left alone. Reading mail via
Mail.app is blocked too (any osascript driving Mail.app), because read also has a
sanctioned API path (`/api/email/inbox|search|message`).

Fail-open: any parse/error lets the command through — a guard must never wedge a
tool call (the amux hook rule).
