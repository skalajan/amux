# Build and run amux-server for the e2e harness from COMMITTED HEAD (AMUX-2924).
#
# WHY NOT THE WORKING TREE. This is a SHARED checkout — CLAUDE.md's deploy
# section is about several sessions committing to it at once — and playwright's
# webServer used to run `cargo run -p amux-server` right here in it. So any peer
# who happened to be mid-edit when your suite started failed YOUR run, with a
# Rust compile error, against changes that might be JS-only. That happened on
# 2026-08-11: E0432 out of session_verbs.rs during a run whose diff touched only
# app.js and a .spec.ts. `cargo check` passed 40s later, once the peer saved.
#
# The lost minutes are not the point. The danger is that a red e2e run caused by
# a stranger's half-saved file is INDISTINGUISHABLE from a red run caused by
# your own change, so the natural response — doubt your patch — is aimed at the
# wrong thing. Committed source is also what actually ships (the builder deploys
# HEAD, not the tree), so HEAD is the honest thing to test.
#
# THE TRAP THIS COULD HAVE ADDED, and why the notice below is not decoration:
# defaulting to HEAD means uncommitted work is NOT under test. A developer
# iterating on a fix would watch their change have no effect, which is a
# quieter failure than the one being fixed. So a dirty tree is announced
# loudly, by name, every run — and AMUX_E2E_WORKING_TREE=1 opts back in for
# exactly that workflow.

# cannot make a worktree — a shallow CI checkout, a read-only $HOME, a git too
# old — would otherwise kill this script, and playwright reports that as
# "Process from config.webServer was not able to start", which reads as a
# broken harness rather than a git problem. On CI the tree IS HEAD, so the
# fallback is exact there; locally it is the old behaviour with a loud line
# saying so. Degrading to the previous behaviour beats refusing to run.

# SERIALIZE THE GIT OPS — this script now runs THREE TIMES CONCURRENTLY, once
# per playwright project (AF-46 gave each target its own server and AMUX_HOME).
# The worktree below is deliberately SHARED and stable, so three simultaneous
# copies would `worktree add` / `checkout --detach` / in the worst case `rm -rf`
# the same directory at the same moment. That race was already reachable — two
# sessions running e2e at once on this shared checkout — it was just rare enough
# to look like nothing.

# purpose: cargo has its own build lock, and CLAUDE.md's measurement is that a
# second builder waits and then finds the work already done (1.48s alone, 1.65s
# for two). Holding this lock across the build would serialize three cold builds
