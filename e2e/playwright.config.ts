// ONE SERVER AND ONE AMUX_HOME PER PROJECT — not one shared by all of them
// (AF-46, measured 2026-08-13).
//
// Projects multiply every spec file: with three of them, settings.spec.ts runs
// three times CONCURRENTLY. That file POSTs global server state (/api/prefs,
// /api/settings/*) and then asserts the UI reflects the value IT just wrote, so
// against a shared store the three copies overwrite each other and whichever
// loses reports a product bug. Under the shared-server config the failures were
// real, repeatable in aggregate and different every run (7 tests one run, 3 the
// next); run alone against the SAME WebKit target the same file passed 27/27.
//
// The tempting reading is "WebKit is flaky" and the tempting fix is a retry or
// a skip — which would have bought green by deleting the signal. The defect is
// that the harness had no isolation boundary between projects at all, and it
// would have come back the moment anyone added a fourth project or a fourth
// state-mutating spec. A port and a home each is the boundary; adding a target
// below now costs nothing and races nothing.

  // render without overflow.
  { name: 'mobile', port: 18833, use: { viewport: { width: 375, height: 667 } } },
  // iOS SAFARI IS ITS OWN TARGET, not a viewport (AMUX tab-customizer, 2026-08-13).
  // A bottom-sheet fix passed desktop+mobile Chromium at 375px while Ethan still
  // could not see the menu on his phone — Chromium at a phone WIDTH is not Safari
  // on a phone. WebKit differs on exactly what this UI depends on: position:fixed
  // inside a transformed ancestor, env(safe-area-inset-*), and dvh/vh behaviour.
  //
  // It runs the WHOLE suite. It briefly did not: a `testMatch` narrowed it to
  // four layout specs because the cross-project races above were misread as
  // iOS-specific reds. That scoping was honest about what it covered and still
  // wrong in effect — a new mobile spec would silently never reach iOS, which
  // is the one target that motivated the project. Isolation removed the reason
  // for it, so the list is gone; do not reintroduce one to quiet a red.

// SAY OUT LOUD WHAT EACH TARGET ACTUALLY COVERS, every run.
//
// The failure this exists to catch is not a red test — it is a GREEN one that
// covered less than its name promised. ios-safari carried a `testMatch` listing
// four spec files, so "ios-safari ✓" meant four files while reading, to anyone
// scanning CI, like iOS was covered. Nothing in the output distinguished those
// two states, and the narrowing was invisible in exactly the place people look.
//
// So a scoped target now announces itself on every run and names the count. A
// future narrowing cannot be silent, which is the property that was missing —
// not a rule telling the next person to remember (CLAUDE.md: a fix owes a
// signal, or the next instance is just as invisible as this one was).
