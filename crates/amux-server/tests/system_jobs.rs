//! `GET /api/system-jobs` + the tripwire that keeps its registry honest
//! (AMUX-2703).
//!
//! The registry is only worth anything if it cannot silently miss a job. Two
//! mechanisms make that true, and this file tests both:
//!
//! 1. `spawn_periodic_every` is the ONLY constructor of a `PeriodicTask` and
//!    registers unconditionally — covered by the unit test in
//!    `runtime_jobs::registry`.
//! 2. Long-lived loops that are not `PeriodicTask`s go through
//!    `registry::spawn_loop` / `adopt` at their call site in `lib.rs`. Nothing
//!    in the type system enforces that, so [`unregistered_spawns`] reads
//!    `lib.rs` AS TEXT and fails on a bare `tokio::spawn` of a background
//!    loop.
//!
//! That second check is a source scan, which is exactly the shape of probe
//! ethos rule 7 warns about — a hand-written guess about where the answer
//! lives, whose miss is indistinguishable from a pass. So it is run against a
//! DOCTORED copy of the same source as a negative control: if the scanner
//! cannot flag an obviously-bad file, its verdict on the real one means
//! nothing.
