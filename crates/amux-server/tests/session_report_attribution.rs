//! AMUX-2646 — a self-report must come from the session it describes, and a
//! test must not be able to write into the live fleet's report store.
//!
//! THE INCIDENT. `amux-rust` showed `idle` on its card while its pane plainly
//! read `esc to interrupt`. Its stored self-report was
//! `{"state":"idle","source":"stop-hook-test","age_s":1076}` — a hand-run hook
//! test had written a fabricated `idle` onto a LIVE working lane. Every
//! consumer of that store (the card, the steering gate, the board's `stale`
//! flag) then believed it, and the derivation's asymmetric freshness rule
//! meant it would have been believed for 24 hours.
//!
//! TWO SEPARATE HOLES, and they need separate fixes because neither closes the
//! other:
//!
//!   * `/report` accepted any state for any session from any caller, and kept
//!     no verified record of who wrote it. `source` is a free string the
//!     CALLER picks, so it labels a write, it does not attribute one. Closed
//!     by the `X-Amux-Session` stamp check, tested below.
//!   * a test process could reach `~/.amux/amux.db` at all. Closed by this
//!     file running against a temp store AND a temp `AMUX_HOME`, with a guard
//!     test that fails if that ever stops being true — a test-isolation rule
//!     nobody can verify is one that quietly lapses.
//!
//! Why not "refuse sources that look synthetic" (a `*-test` suffix check):
//! `source` is chosen by the caller, so the identical write named `stop-hook`
//! passes. That is a check that cannot fail against the case it exists for.
