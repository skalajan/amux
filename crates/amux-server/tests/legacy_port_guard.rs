//! A hardcoded `…:8822` must not come back (2026-08-10).
//!
//! 8824 is the address. 8822 is the RETIRED one, answered only by a countdown
//! compatibility bind for sessions started before the cutover, whose process
//! env cannot be rotated (`amux_server::legacy_port`, and the exit condition in
//! docs/rust-migration/server-boundary.md).
//!
//! Retiring it took ~180 edits across two CLIs, the dashboard, the scripts, the
//! e2e configs, the docs and the fleet's agent instructions — because a port
//! literal is the cheapest thing in the world to type and nothing was watching.
//! One `format!("...localhost:8822")` in `session_verbs.rs` was re-minting the
//! retired address into every newly-spawned session's env, which is the whole
//! reason the population never shrank; the cloud image's Dockerfile then had to
//! bind 8822 *to match that literal*, and said so in a comment. A single
//! hardcoded port had pinned two deployments.
//!
//! So this is the tmux-target-audit shape: enumerate the tree, fail on the
//! literal, and keep an allowlist that has to state a REASON per entry. The
//! allowlist is the interesting part — every row is something that legitimately
//! names the old port, and a row with no reason is how the guard rots into a
//! rubber stamp.
//!
//! # What counts as a violation
//!
//! An ADDRESS: `:8822` immediately preceded by a host token
//! (`localhost:8822`, `your-server:8822`, `127.0.0.1:8822`, `foo.ts.net:8822`).
//!
//! NOT prose: "the Python server on :8822", "answers 8822 and 8824". Narrative
//! about the migration is history and teaches nobody to dial it; an address is
//! a thing a client will actually use. Guarding the prose too would mean every
//! historical comment needed an allowlist row, the allowlist would become
//! noise, and noise is how a guard stops being read.
