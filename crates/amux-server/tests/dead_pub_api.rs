//! `pub` items in a lib crate are invisible to `dead_code` — this is the check
//! that can fail (AMUX-2910).
//!
//! On 2026-08-11 `api/py_proxy.rs` was found carrying an entire python
//! forwarder — `forward_built`, `forward_to_python`, `forward_handler`,
//! `passthrough_routes` — with ZERO call sites anywhere. Not merely dead: its
//! default target had become this same process on the retired legacy bind, so a
//! future proxy row would have self-proxy-looped. `cargo clippy --workspace
//! --all-targets -- -D warnings`, the standing pre-push gate that CI also
//! enforces, passed on it every single run, because rustc treats a `pub` item
//! in a lib crate as reachable by definition. amux-server is almost entirely
//! `pub`, so the gate that is supposed to catch exactly this is blind to all of
//! it.
//!
//! **WHAT THIS TEST IS NOT.** It matches BARE NAMES across the workspace, so a
//! function mentioned only in a comment, or sharing a name with an unrelated
//! identifier, counts as referenced. That direction is deliberate — it makes
//! false ALARMS very unlikely and false CLEARS possible — so the result is a
//! FLOOR on dead code, never a proof of its absence. A green run means "no
//! NEW obviously-dead pub fn", not "nothing here is dead".
//!
//! It is worth having anyway: the forwarder would have been caught by it, and
//! measured against the whole crate the answer is small enough to act on (496
//! `pub fn`, 1 unreferenced), which is what makes a hard assertion affordable
//! rather than a wall of noise somebody force-merges past.
