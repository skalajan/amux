//! ROUTER-ONLY sweep harness (RR-0130 / RR-0131a / RR-0131b / RR-0131d).
//!
//! The live-data acceptance sweeps have to answer one question: does the Rust
//! API expose every row the shared DB holds, in the shape the SPA reads? That
//! requires pointing a server at a COPY of the live DB **and at the real
//! `$AMUX_HOME`** — because a large share of the surface (session memory,
//! steering history, browser-profile inventory, the `amux` flag on token
//! rows) is keyed off `$AMUX_HOME/sessions/*.env`, `$AMUX_HOME/memory/` and
//! `$AMUX_HOME/playwright-auth/`. Run with an isolated home and every one of
//! those surfaces answers empty — which reads exactly like a porting gap and
//! is really just the harness blindfolding itself.
//!
//! WHY THIS EXISTS AND NOT `amux-server` ITSELF. The real binary spawns three
//! loops that DRIVE THE LIVE FLEET, and all three enumerate their targets from
//! `$AMUX_HOME/sessions/*.env`:
//!
//! - `steer_deliver_loop` -> `send_text_inner` -> real tmux keystrokes into
//!   whichever lane a `steering_queue` row names (the copy DB has 16 such rows
//!   pointing at live lanes);
//! - `ghost_rescue` -> presses Enter in any lane whose pane shows an
//!   unsubmitted amux message;
//! - `board_drive` -> auto-pickup + advance nudges to every lane holding a card.
//!
//! Point the real binary at the real home and those three fire against the
//! running fleet using a STALE COPY of the board as their input. So the sweep
//! server is the router and nothing else: `api::router(AppState)` has no
//! `tokio::spawn` anywhere in it (verified against api/mod.rs), which makes
//! "cannot touch the fleet" a structural property of the process rather than a
//! promise about which requests I remembered not to send.
//!
//! It is still not a toy: it is the SAME `api::router` composition the
//! production binary serves, over the same `Store`, so a shape or count
//! difference found here is a real difference. What it deliberately cannot
//! exercise is behaviour that only the background loops produce — those belong
//! to the restart suite (`tests/restart_persistence.rs`), which drives the real
//! binary against a scratch DB where the loops have nothing live to act on.
//!
//! Plain HTTP on purpose (the production binary is HTTPS): TLS here would only
//! add a self-signed cert to every curl in the sweep and prove nothing about
//! data exposure.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   cargo run -p amux-server --example sweep_server -- <db-path> <port>
//!
//! The DB path MUST be a `.backup` copy. The harness refuses to open the live
//! database by path so a mistyped argument cannot turn a read-only sweep into
//! a write against real user data (ethos rule 8).
