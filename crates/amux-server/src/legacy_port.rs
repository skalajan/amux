//! Legacy-port accounting — who is still stranded on the retired 8822 address,
//! now that its bind is gone.
//!
//! # History (why this module exists)
//!
//! When the Python server was retired, the Rust server answered a second,
//! historical port (`AMUX_RS_LEGACY_PORT`, 8822) because ~60 live fleet sessions
//! carried `AMUX_URL=https://localhost:8822` in their PROCESS env, and a live
//! process's env cannot be rotated. That bind was pure carry-over, always a
//! countdown rather than an address, and the only responsible way to decide "is
//! anything still calling it?" was to measure rather than guess (Ethos rule 4:
//! if a wrong answer would not be detectable from the data we keep, the missing
//! instrument IS the bug). So this module counted hits on the legacy listener
//! BY LAYER (below), turning the retirement decision into a number.
//!
//! # The bind is GONE (Ethan, 2026-08-11: "no more 8822 just rust")
//!
//! Ethan dropped it ahead of the automatic 7-day-quiet exit; `lib.rs` records
//! why and forbids re-adding it. Two consequences the rest of this file is
//! shaped by:
//!
//!   1. The hit counter still exists but reads 0 BY CONSTRUCTION — nothing
//!      listens on 8822, so a stranded lane's `curl $AMUX_URL/...` fails at
//!      connect and records no hit. Hit-based "still in use" therefore collapses
//!      to CLEAR while lanes are in fact broken, which is why the LIVE signal is
//!      now the process-env scan (`scan_stranded_sessions`, AMUX-2988), reported
//!      hourly (WARN naming the sessions) and by `GET /api/debug/legacy-port` as
//!      `stranded_count` / `stranded_sessions`.
//!   2. The remedy for a stranded lane is `$(amux url)` — which reads
//!      `endpoint.json` and self-heals past the dead env — or restarting the
//!      lane. NOT restoring the bind (AMUX-3046).
//!
//! # How the count was taken (retained for the retired-port guard + tests)
//!
//! By LAYER on the legacy listener's router clone, not by sniffing the `Host`
//! header: the two listeners shared one `app`, so a request was counted iff it
//! physically arrived on that socket. A `Host` header is client-supplied and
//! would have counted a request that merely *said* 8822 while arriving on 8824.
//! Kept because `RETIRED_PORTS` and the endpoint contract still drive the
//! stranded-lane detection and its tests.
