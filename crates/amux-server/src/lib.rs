    // AMUX_URL was baked into live process envs that cannot be rotated, so the
    // rust server answered the old port too — same router, same TLS, same auth.

    // calling it, ahead of the automatic 7-day-quiet exit.

    // are launched with AMUX_URL derived from `config::canonical_port()`
    // (session_verbs.rs), the CLI defaults to the canonical port, and
    // `publish_endpoint` below writes the real address for the one client class
    // that can be told no other way — a hook spawned by a pre-cutover process,
    // which inherits the stale variable and whose DEFAULT therefore never
    // fires. Any lane still holding the old address gets connection-refused,
    // which is loud and fixed by restarting that lane.
