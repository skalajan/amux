//! # Why this exists in this shape
//!
//! Every recent cutover incident had the same structure: two subsystems each
//! looked healthy on its own and disagreed with each other, and nothing was
//! looking at the SEAM. `amux send` returned exit 0 while delivering raw
//! keystrokes; the steering queue accepted writes forever with no consumer;
//! `server.env` held values that never reached `std::env::var`; a route
//! answered 200 on one spelling and 405 on the other. None of those is
//! detectable by a component health check, because no component was broken.
//!
//! So the unit here is a CONTRADICTION between two sources of truth, and every
//! check must name both sides (`expected` / `observed`) rather than returning a
//! bare bool.
//!
//! # Three rules this module enforces on itself
//!
//! 1. **`Unknown` is not `Pass`.** A probe that could not run reports
//!    [`Status::Unknown`], never a cheerful pass. Turning a failed observation
//!    into healthy-looking empty state is the single most repeated bug in this
//!    codebase's history (`running=0` indistinguishable from an empty fleet;
//!    `unwrap_or_default()` in observability paths). [`Status::Unknown`] is
//!    surfaced distinctly all the way to the dashboard.
//!
//! 2. **A check that cannot fail is not a check.** Every invariant registered
//!    here must ship with a negative-control test that INJECTS the failure and
//!    asserts detection (AMUX-2624). `cargo test invariant_negative_control`
//!    is the gate; see the tests at the bottom of each check module.
//!
//! 3. **Evaluations are recorded, not just failures.** `_amux_invariant_result`
//!    gets a row per evaluation so "this check stopped running" is visible.
//!    A monitor that dies silently is worse than no monitor, because its
//!    silence is read as health.
