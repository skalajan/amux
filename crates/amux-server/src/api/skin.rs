//! `GET /api/skin` — the resolved skin for a worker (or the global default).
//!
//! Ethan: "a way to add skins (powered by the amux api) so it should be trivial
//! to build a new ux… then we create a skin for every vertical (terms, ux,
//! coloring, etc.)".
//!
//! # Why this is a scope capability and not a `/api/skins` subsystem
//!
//! A skin is terminology, colours and which tabs are visible. Every one of
//! those is per-scope configuration, and amux already has exactly one uniform
//! per-scope contract (`/api/scope`, `SCOPE_CAPS`). Adding `skin` as a
//! descriptor row means it inherits the global -> group -> worker precedence,
//! the write authorization (a session may write only its own worker layer),
//! and the `interaction_log` audit row — none of which a new subsystem would
//! have had, and all of which it would eventually have needed.
//!
//! This endpoint is the RESOLVER: `/api/scope` answers "what is set AT this
//! level", which is what a configuration screen needs; a client rendering a
//! skin needs "what do I actually get", which is a different question and the
//! reason both exist.
//!
//! # The merge
//!
//! Per-key, deep for objects: a group skin that renames one noun does not have
//! to restate the global palette, and a worker overriding one colour does not
//! drop the group's terminology. `replace` would force every layer to be a
//! complete skin, which is what makes theme systems unusable.
