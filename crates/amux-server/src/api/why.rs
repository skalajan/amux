//! RR-0109 — generalized `why` query system (Invariant 24).
//!
//! "Why did this happen?" answered from the durable trails amux already keeps,
//! never from grep over a log file: the state-event journal with its
//! post-mutation payload snapshots (`_amux_state_events`, see `db/replay.rs`),
//! the structured request log (`_amux_request_log`), board card history
//! (`issues.log`), schedule runs and audit, the turn ledger (`_amux_turns`),
//! commands, sessions, and the interaction log.
//!
//! `GET /api/why/{kind}/{id}` for `task` | `worker` | `command` | `schedule` |
//! `session` | `integration`, and `GET /api/why?since=&until=` for a window.
//! The CLI verb (`amux-rs why …`) is a printer over this endpoint and does not
//! re-implement any of the correlation — one place to be wrong is enough.
//!
//! ## This is an instrument, so it must be able to say "I cannot tell"
//!
//! Ethos rule 4: a diagnosis being impossible from the available data IS the
//! bug, and the failure mode of an explainer is to narrate confidently from
//! whatever it happened to find. Three things guard against that:
//!
//! 1. **Every timeline line cites its source** — table plus a row reference
//!    (`rowid`, `rev`) — so any claim can be re-checked with one SELECT.
//! 2. **Every source is reported even when it returned nothing**, with the
//!    predicate it ran. A zero from a probe that COULD have matched and a zero
//!    from a probe that never could look identical otherwise, and only the
//!    second is a gap.
//! 3. **`verdict` is `cannot_tell` when the evidence does not support a
//!    story**, and `gaps` names what is missing. `partial` is the answer when
//!    some trail covers the entity and another structurally cannot.
//!
//! ## Timestamp units differ per table, and getting that wrong is the classic
//! silent-wrong-answer here
//!
//! `issues.created/updated`, `schedule_runs.ran_at`, `logs.ts` are unix
//! SECONDS. `_amux_request_log.ts` and `session_events.ts` are REAL unix
//! seconds. `interaction_log.ts` is MILLISECONDS (ethos.md records two
//! sessions in one evening writing `datetime(ts,'unixepoch')` against it and
//! getting a filter ~1000x too small, which matched the entire table while
//! looking like a correct answer). Each read below converts explicitly and
//! says which unit it assumed.
