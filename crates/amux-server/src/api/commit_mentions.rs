//! `GET /api/board/commit-mentions` — open cards named in a merged commit.
//!
//! AMUX-2674. Five cards sat in `todo` while ONE commit (e679bdb) fixed all
//! five and named every id in its body. Auto-pickup kept offering finished work,
//! each card costing a full scope-and-decide cycle to rediscover, and anyone
//! reading the board saw five live-in-production defects as open.
//!
//! The data was already there and machine-readable — nothing read it. That is
//! the same shape as AC-323's `ignored_fields`: a correct signal with no
//! consumer. This is the consumer.
//!
//! # It SURFACES, it never closes
//!
//! A card id in a commit is NOT proof of completion. Commits reference cards for
//! context, for partial work, and for reverts. Auto-closing on a mention would
//! silently close open work — ethos rule 8, and precisely what the board's
//! done-vs-verified split exists to prevent. So this endpoint is a GET that
//! mutates nothing and reports candidates for a human or session to judge.
//!
//! # Which cards it looks at, and why not pickup's predicate
//!
//! Ethos rule 1's corollary: a view must share the predicate of the mechanism it
//! claims to describe, or it is worse than no view. This one describes the
//! BOARD'S OPEN SET — "cards that still read as open while a merged commit says
//! otherwise" — so its predicate is openness: `status IN ('todo','doing')`, not
//! deleted, not archived.
//!
//! It deliberately does NOT copy `board_drive`'s pickup predicate
//! (`owner_type='agent'`, no `needs:you` tag, type not tripwire/watch, plus
//! freshness and reclaim windows). Those encode *who may be handed this next*,
//! which is a different question — a human-owned card fixed by a merged commit
//! is exactly as stale, and filtering it out would hide it. If you find yourself
//! "fixing" this to match pickup, that is the deviation; it is intentional and
//! this paragraph is why.
