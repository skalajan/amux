/// one never wired into `evaluate_all` produce byte-identical bodies. Adding a
/// check and then confirming it is live therefore sent its own author to the
/// wrong endpoint for eight polls. The filtered form reports `ran` explicitly,
/// and on a miss it returns `known_ids` so a typo cannot masquerade as "not
/// wired in" — the two are indistinguishable from an empty result alone, and
/// the wrong one of them prompts you to go re-edit working code.
