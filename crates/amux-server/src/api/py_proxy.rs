//! The rust/python boundary REGISTRY — and, post-cutover, the standing proof
//! that nothing proxies any more.
//!
//! **The boundary is a TABLE, not archaeology** (AMUX-2597: "there needs to be
//! a clear separation between the two servers"). [`PROXIED_FAMILIES`] is that
//! table; it is EMPTY (AMUX-2608 cut the last row, `/api/scope`) and
//! `tests/proxy_composition.rs` fails the build if a row reappears. Runtime
//! view: `GET /api/debug/boundary` — ethos rule 4, the separation must be
//! enumerable where people already look. Full matrix:
//! docs/rust-migration/server-boundary.md.
//!
//! **The forwarding machinery is GONE (AMUX-2906), and it is not coming back.**
//! It was kept after the last cutover "for a future row". Two facts retired
//! that rationale:
//!
//! 1. The Python server was DELETED at 792ce1f. CLAUDE.md is explicit — do not
//!    resurrect it or add anything that depends on it — so there is no future
//!    row for the machinery to serve.
//! 2. Worse, it had become actively dangerous. `py_base()` defaulted to
//!    localhost on the RETIRED legacy port — which, since the cutover, is THIS
//!    SAME PROCESS answering on its compatibility bind (verified: identical
//!    `pid` and `build` on the retired port and the canonical one). A
//!    `Namespace` row would therefore have forwarded a request to ourselves,
//!    re-entered the same passthrough, and looped — every hop holding a 600s
//!    reqwest timeout and an unbounded buffered body in RAM. Machinery that
//!    would hang the server is not machinery a future row "needs".
//!
//! `crates/amux-server/tests/legacy_port_guard.rs` had already reasoned to the
//! same conclusion in its allowlist ("this default is unreachable; it dies with
//! the module") and its `allowlist_rows_are_live_and_reasoned` check enforces
//! it: the row is now gone because the literal is.
//!
//! Git history has the forwarder (buffered bodies for Python's
//! `Content-Length`-only reader, a hop-by-hop header denylist, the
//! `x-amux-answered-by: python-proxy` stamp) if a genuine cross-process proxy
//! is ever needed. The transport lesson worth keeping — why a passthrough must
//! use explicit routes rather than `.fallback()` — moved to the SPA catch-all
//! in mod.rs, which is where it stays true.
