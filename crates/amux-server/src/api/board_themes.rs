//! `GET /api/board/themes` — what this board is actually about, and what to
//! call it (AMUX-2640).
//!
//! Ethan: "you should be able to suggest relevant tags per board based on
//! themes. we can cluster tasks by themes as more are added based on semantic
//! similarity."
//!
//! # Why this is not an embedding pipeline
//!
//! The card proposed embedding titles, caching per revision, clustering by
//! similarity, and suggesting THE CLUSTER'S TAG. Measured on the live board
//! before building it:
//!
//! ```text
//! cards with any tag      207 / 4831  (4.3%)
//! distinct tags           35, of which 29 are identifier-shaped (hrsla:…, needs:you)
//! theme-shaped tags       6
//! theme tags on >=3 cards 1  (`hand-raiser-sla`, and it is auto-applied)
//! ```
//!
//! So "suggest the cluster's tag" has exactly ONE tag it could ever propagate.
//! An embedding service, a per-revision cache and a similarity threshold, to
//! spread one auto-applied tag, is a model call doing the work of a `GROUP BY`
//! (ethos rule 2) plus a pinned model that cannot improve (D3).
//!
//! The useful question at 4.3% tagging is the other direction: not "which
//! existing tag fits this cluster" but "what IS this pile of work about, and
//! what should we call it". Titles exist on all 4831 cards, so that question is
//! answerable today, for free, deterministically.
//!
//! # What it does instead
//!
//! Distinctive-term clustering over open card titles. A term earns theme status
//! by appearing on enough cards to be a body of work, but not so many that it
//! describes the whole board — the same mid-frequency band a human eye uses when
//! skimming a column.
//!
//! This is LEXICAL, not semantic, and says so rather than implying otherwise:
//! "cutover" and "migration" stay separate clusters here. That is the honest
//! upgrade path — when the tag vocabulary is large enough that propagation
//! beats discovery, embeddings replace `theme_terms` alone, and every consumer
//! of this endpoint gets better output without changing.
