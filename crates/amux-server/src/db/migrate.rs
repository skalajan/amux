//! Migration runner (RR-0019).
//!
//! Migrations are numbered SQL files embedded at compile time from
//! `crates/amux-server/migrations/`. Applied in order inside one exclusive
//! transaction each, tracked in `_amux_migrations`. Two special forms:
//!
//! - Plain SQL statements: executed as a batch.
//! - `-- ADDCOL: <table> <column> <decl...>` directive lines: applied as
//!   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN` ONLY when the column is absent. SQLite has
//!   no `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`, and the baseline schema mirrors a live
//!   Python database whose tables may or may not already carry the column —
//!   the directive makes the migration idempotent against both shapes.
//!
//! The Python server must be able to keep opening the same DB file after
//! these run (Phase 11 rollback requirement), so migrations are ADDITIVE
//! ONLY: no drops, no renames, no type changes.
