//! RR-0111a — replay-capable event log, AUDIT slice (Invariants 24, 30).
//!
//! The `_amux_state_events` journal always recorded THAT something changed
//! (rev, entity, mutation kind); since migration 0008 each event can also
//! carry the POST-MUTATION snapshot of its entity row (`payload`, written in
//! the same transaction — see `PendingEvent.payload` in `db/mod.rs`). This
//! module folds that journal back into state and checks the fold against the
//! live tables: the plan's **audit replay** mode ("read-only, verify that
//! events reproduce the recorded state transitions" — a744dde). Debug/fork
//! replay and the per-turn capture contract need turn instrumentation that
//! does not exist yet; they layer on top of this journal when it does.
//!
//! Honesty rules, in order of how expensively they were learned:
//!
//! - **Never pretend to reconstruct what was not recorded.** An event without
//!   a payload leaves its entity's state UNKNOWN from that rev on — replay
//!   reports it under `pre_payload_horizon` with the first rev from which a
//!   full replay is possible, instead of passing off an older snapshot as
//!   current (ethos rule 7: a check that cannot fail is theatre; a replay
//!   that fabricates is a check that cannot fail).
//! - **Divergences are named individually** — entity id, differing fields,
//!   both values — never rolled into a count (ethos rule 4: the discriminator
//!   belongs where the reader already looks).
//! - **Caps announce themselves.** The report's lists are capped for the API
//!   response, but totals are always exact and `lists_capped_at` says what
//!   was cut (Invariant 40: an omission must announce itself).
