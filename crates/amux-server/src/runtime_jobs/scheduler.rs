//! Durable schedules (RR-0058 CRUD/history/audit/source, RR-0059 expression
//! parser, RR-0060 missed-run + retry) over the LIVE `schedules`,
//! `schedule_runs` and `schedule_audit` tables.
//!
//! # Strangler-fig contract
//!
//! These are the SAME rows the Python server on :8822 reads and writes, so
//! every column name, value shape and clock here mirrors `amux-server.py`:
//!
//! - `schedules.next_run` / `run_at`: LOCAL wall-clock strings
//!   `"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M"` (never UTC — the Python fire loop compares them
//!   against `datetime.now()`; comparing against UTC would fire hours off).
//! - `schedules.last_run`, `schedule_runs.ran_at`, `schedule_audit.ts`,
//!   `schedules.created/updated`: UTC unix seconds (AMUX-1736 — one clock
//!   for run history).
//! - `schedule_runs.source` discriminates WHY a fire happened (ethos rule 4:
//!   the manual-vs-cron incident). Python writes `cron`, `manual:<who>`,
//!   `trigger:<event>`; the Rust loop writes `cron-rs` and run-now writes
//!   `manual:<who>` — the `-rs` suffix keeps "which scheduler fired this"
//!   answerable from the row during the dual-scheduler period.
//!
//! # Dual-scheduler safety (see runtime_jobs/mod.rs for the full statement)
//!
//! ONLY the Python server fires schedules until `AMUX_RS_SCHEDULER=1` is
//! set. With firing disabled, [`run_scheduler`] runs in SHADOW MODE: it
//! computes due schedules and journals `Other("schedule_shadow")` events
//! into `_amux_state_events` — never touching `schedules`/`schedule_runs` —
//! so Phase 11 can diff shadow events against Python's actual fires. Even
//! with firing enabled, each fire re-checks the row inside the write
//! transaction, so an occurrence Python already advanced is not re-fired.
//! NOTE: enabling `AMUX_RS_SCHEDULER=1` while the Python scheduler is also
//! running is the double-fire configuration; don't.
//!
//! # Timezone semantics
//!
//! Next-run computation uses `chrono::Local`, exactly like Python's
//! `datetime.now()` — a "daily at 9am" means 9am on this machine's wall
//! clock, through DST changes. Nonexistent local times (spring-forward gap)
//! resolve forward to the first representable instant; ambiguous times
//! (fall-back) take the earlier occurrence.
