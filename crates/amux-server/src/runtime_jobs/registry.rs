//! The live registry of amux's OWN background jobs — `GET /api/system-jobs`.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! On 2026-08-10 three of the server's internal loops were dead or had never
//! been spawned at all, for hours, with nothing visible anywhere: the schedule
//! firing loop had ZERO call sites (AMUX-2647), session log piping had lost
//! its writer (AMUX-2671), and the board -> worker drive loop did not exist
//! after the cutover (AMUX-2637). None of them errored, because **the failure
//! shape is pure absence** — a loop that is not running and a loop with
//! nothing to do produce byte-identical evidence. The Scheduler tab showed 113
//! user schedules and said nothing about the ten jobs that actually keep the
//! fleet moving.
//!
//! This module is the answer to ethos rule 4 ("would a wrong answer be
//! detectable from the data you keep?") applied to the server's own plumbing:
//! every internal job, its last tick, and a status that can say STALLED.
//!
//! # What this is NOT
//!
//! It is **not** a second scheduler, and it does not turn system jobs into
//! `schedules` rows. See this module's parent docs for why `DurableSchedule`
//! and `PeriodicTask` are deliberately different types with no conversion
//! between them: user schedules are owned data with history and audit; these
//! are machinery the user can neither own nor delete, and folding them into
//! the user's list would be ethos rules 3 and 8 in one move. So the endpoint
//! is a separate surface, the UI renders it as a separate section, and there
//! is no delete, no edit, and no run-now.
//!
//! # Why the registry cannot drift from the spawn sites
//!
//! A hand-maintained list of "jobs we think are running" is worth nothing: it
//! agrees with reality exactly until someone adds a loop, and the day it
//! disagrees is the day you need it. So EXISTENCE here is never declared, it
//! is observed, by two mechanisms that both sit at the spawn:
//!
//! 1. [`super::spawn_periodic_every`] is the ONLY constructor of
//!    [`super::PeriodicTask`] (its fields are private and there is no other
//!    `impl`). It calls [`register`] unconditionally and wraps the job's own
//!    closure so that every tick's start and end are recorded by the SPAWNER,
//!    not by the job. A new `PeriodicTask` is in this registry whether or not
//!    its author has ever heard of this file, and its tick timing cannot lie,
//!    because the job does not report it.
//! 2. Long-lived loops that are not `PeriodicTask`s are spawned through
//!    [`spawn_loop`] / [`adopt`] at their call site in `lib.rs`, and
//!    `tests/system_jobs.rs` reads `lib.rs` as text and fails if a bare
//!    `tokio::spawn` of a background loop appears outside that allow-list.
//!
//! [`CATALOG`] carries PROSE ONLY — the one-sentence purpose, the env var or
//! pref that controls the job, and the existing debug endpoint that holds its
//! detail. It never gates existence: a registered job with no catalog entry
//! still renders, flagged `documented: false`, so the failure mode of
//! forgetting to document a job is a visible blank, not an invisible job.
//!
//! The catalog does carry one signal existence cannot: a job that is
//! DOCUMENTED and NOT REGISTERED is the AMUX-2647 shape — a loop nobody
//! started — and it renders as `not_spawned`, loudly. When its control env var
//! says it is off, it renders as `disabled` instead. That discriminator is the
//! whole point: "off because a human said so" and "off because nobody called
//! it" looked the same for hours.
//!
//! # Outcomes come from the jobs' own reports, not a copy
//!
//! Several jobs already publish a debug surface with the real answer
//! (`/api/debug/autofix`, `/api/debug/board-drive`, `/api/debug/storage`,
//! `/api/debug/steering`). [`outcome_for`] reads those modules' own
//! `last_report()` accessors in-process — a second store of the same fact
//! would be a second thing to keep in step, and the two would eventually
//! disagree in front of someone debugging. Because it is a `match` on typed
//! accessors rather than a JSON copy, deleting a report is a COMPILE error
//! here, not a silently empty field.
