//! Pane-size restoration (AMUX-2634) — a VIEWER must not be able to degrade a
//! WORKER.
//!
//! # The bug
//!
//! Opening a peek POSTs `/resize` so the tmux window matches the reader's
//! measured character width; Claude Code then reflows its transcript to that
//! width, which is what makes peek natively responsive instead of
//! double-wrapped on a phone. The capture endpoint takes no width parameter —
//! it returns whatever tmux already hard-wrapped — so resizing the pane is the
//! only lever the feature has.
//!
//! The catch is documented in tmux's own manual: `resize-window` "will
//! automatically set `window-size` to `manual` in the window options". That
//! permanently detaches the window from its session `default-size`. Nothing
//! ever set it back, so **the viewer's width became the worker's width,
//! forever**. Measured on the live fleet before this landed: 12 amux panes
//! below the configured 220 columns, one of them pinned at the client's floor
//! of 50x50 by a single phone peek. Every turn that worker took afterwards —
//! its reasoning, its diffs, its tables — was wrapped into a 50-column column
//! because somebody once glanced at it on a phone.
//!
//! # Why a restorer and not restore-on-close
//!
//! Restore-on-close is the obvious fix and it is not sufficient: it only runs
//! when the client is polite. A backgrounded phone, a killed tab, a dropped
//! network or a crashed browser all skip teardown, and those are exactly the
//! circumstances of the reported incident. A fix that depends on the viewer
//! behaving cannot make the guarantee "a viewer can never degrade a worker".
//!
//! So the guarantee lives server-side and the client holds a LEASE. Every
//! `/resize` (including the no-op "already sized" answer) refreshes it; the
//! SPA re-sends one every 30s while a peek is open. When the lease goes stale
//! the sweep restores the pane. A viewer that vanishes therefore costs the
//! worker at most `LEASE_TTL + TICK` of narrow output, bounded and automatic,
//! with no cooperation required.
//!
//! # Why this is a re-port, not a new idea
//!
//! Python had `_tmux_size_watchdog` on a 60s job (py:4443, registered
//! py:78188): restore every DETACHED amux session to the canonical size and
//! reset `window-size latest`. The rust cutover ported `_resize_pane` — the
//! comment on it even cites `py:25832` — and dropped the restorer, which is
//! precisely what turned a transient resize into a permanent one. This module
//! restores that half and adds the lease, which python lacked: python's timer
//! fought an OPEN peek every 60 seconds, re-widening the pane under a reader
//! who was still looking at it.
//!
//! # The three tmux calls, in order, and why all three
//!
//! 1. `set-option -t <s> default-size <C>x<R>` — some sessions were created
//!    without `-x/-y` and inherit the global `default-size 80x24`; without
//!    this, step 3 would snap them straight back to 80x24.
//! 2. `resize-window -t <s> -x <C> -y <R>` — the actual widening.
//! 3. `set-option -w -t <s> window-size latest` — undo the `manual` pin step 2
//!    just set. Without it the window is the right width but still detached
//!    from `default-size`, and a real human attaching later no longer wins.
//!
//! A width restored while the window stays pinned is a half-fix that looks
//! complete from `list-panes`, which is why the pin is asserted separately.
