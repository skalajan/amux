//! `[board-drive]` — the board→worker drive loop (AMUX-2637).
//!
//! # The outage this restores
//!
//! Python owned the entire loop that turns a board into work: `_pickup_next_
//! board_task` (py:14418), `_advance_open_card` (py:13325) and the level sweep
//! that drives both (`_pickup_level_sweep`, py:14305). The cutover carried the
//! board API across and left the loop behind, and the Rust orchestrator only
//! ever dispatches to RUST-managed workers (`pickup_unowned=false`; a
//! python-owned card carries a `foreign_worker_id` and is never assigned). Every
//! fleet session is python-owned, so since the cutover: no assignments, no
//! advance nudges. Cards sat in `todo`, workers sat idle, and NOTHING errored.
//!
//! Pure absence is the failure mode this module is shaped against. Every tick
//! writes a trace (`/api/debug/board-drive`) naming, per lane, what it did and
//! **why it declined** — because a skip that leaves no trace is
//! indistinguishable from a loop that is not running, which is exactly the state
//! the fleet was in for hours (ethos rule 4; Python learned the same thing at
//! py:14208, `_pickup_skip`, after Ethan had to read source to answer "why is
//! this idle lane sitting on 4 todos?").
//!
//! # LEVEL-triggered, never edge-triggered
//!
//! Python fired pickup from `status == "idle" and prev in ("active","waiting")`
//! — an EDGE — and then had to add `_pickup_level_sweep` because the edge is
//! fragile in exactly this process: it re-execs on every deploy, which clears
//! the previous-status map, so an already-idle lane waits for a transition that
//! may never come (primis: IDLE 142 minutes on 3 pickable todos, py:14308).
//! Only the LEVEL sweep is ported. There is no edge to keep in step with it, so
//! the asymmetry that let one half of the edge (advance) go unbackstopped for
//! months (py:14326) cannot recur here.
//!
//! # Delivery is the steering queue, not a second send path
//!
//! Nothing here types into a pane. A nudge or an assignment is
//! `steer_enqueue`'d and the EXISTING delivery loop
//! (`session_verbs::steer_deliver_tick`) applies the turn-boundary gate
//! (`steer_lane_at_boundary`) and the send choreography. Two consequences, both
//! deliberate:
//!
//! 1. A nudge can never land mid-turn. Interrupting a working model to tell it
//!    something it could have read at its next boundary is the interruption the
//!    ethos warns about, and it was a live bug in the steering path four days
//!    ago ("i sent as a queue but it looks like it was sent directly even though
//!    this worker was still working").
//! 2. Delivery is DURABLE. Python called `send_text(...)` and stamped its
//!    cooldown on the return value; a failed send meant the lane got nothing.
//!    Here the row survives a restart and is delivered at the lane's next
//!    boundary.
//!
//! # What is durable, and why that is not a detail
//!
//! Python held the per-session advance cooldown and the per-lane sweep stamp in
//! process memory, on a server that re-execs many times a day — its own comment
//! (py:14627) calls an in-memory cooldown "fiction" after one was wiped by the
//! first reload and re-fired at the same lane within minutes. Every cooldown
//! here reads `session_events`:
//!
//! | bound                     | key                                    |
//! |---------------------------|----------------------------------------|
//! | re-claim (24h, per card)  | `task.claimed`                         |
//! | advance (15m, per lane)   | `advance.nudged` / `needsyou.renag` / `capture.decompose_ask` |
//! | advance budget (3/24h)    | `advance.nudged` per card id           |
//! | decompose (6h, per lane)  | `pickup.decompose_nudge`               |
//! | needs:you re-nag (3d)     | `needsyou.renag` per card id           |
//!
//! `advance.nudged` additionally records the card's STATUS at nudge time, which
//! Python kept only in memory (`_advance_last_card`, py:12960). That is what
//! makes "did this lane make progress since we spoke?" survive a restart, so a
//! lane that moved the card it was nudged about gets the next one immediately
//! instead of waiting out a cooldown it already earned its way past.
