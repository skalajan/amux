//! StructuredCliProtocol (RR-0030): [`AgentProtocol`] over headless
//! structured CLI runs — the orchestrator's ExecuteTask path.
//!
//! One prompt = one child process run in the worker's cwd, speaking the
//! provider's structured stdout format (RR-0028e coverage matrix,
//! docs/provider-coverage.csv):
//!
//! - Claude Code: `claude --print <prompt> --output-format stream-json --verbose`
//! - Gemini CLI:  `gemini -p <prompt> --output-format stream-json`
//! - Codex CLI:   `codex exec --json <prompt>`
//!
//! A reader task per child parses stdout lines via [`super::events`] and
//! broadcasts [`WorkerEvent`]s on the worker's channel. Claude and Gemini
//! streams have no explicit turn-start marker, so the reader inserts
//! `TurnStarted` before the first in-turn event; Codex's literal
//! `turn.started` is passed through and deduplicated.
//!
//! Honest limits of the headless shape, stated rather than faked:
//!
//! - `pause`/`resume` return [`ProtocolError::Rejected`]: a `--print`-style
//!   run has no suspend concept. Faking it (e.g. SIGSTOP silently) would be
//!   state the harness reports but the agent does not have.
//! - `deliver_message` mid-turn returns `Rejected`: there is no stdin
//!   session to inject into. The command queue's `AtTurnBoundary` timing is
//!   the sanctioned retry path (Invariant 34). When idle, a message delivery
//!   IS a new turn, keyed by the durable `MessageId` (Invariant 29), so a
//!   redelivered message never double-runs.
//! - `cancel` sends a real SIGINT via `/bin/kill` (graceful — the CLIs
//!   checkpoint on SIGINT per the spike), falling back to
//!   [`tokio::process::Child::start_kill`] (SIGKILL) only if that fails.
//!   nix/libc are not workspace deps and adding one for a single signal is
//!   not worth the surface; `kill(1)` is POSIX and already everywhere amux
//!   runs. `kill_on_drop(true)` reaps children if the server itself dies.
//!
//! Idempotency (Invariant 9): a `send_prompt` whose `idempotency_key` was
//! already seen for that worker returns `Ok` without re-spawning — restart
//! reconciliation replays enqueues, and this is what makes the replay safe.
//!
//! CONVERSATION CONTINUITY (AMUX-2613 gap 2): successive turns share the
//! provider's own conversation, not just a cwd. The reader captures the
//! conversation ref from the stream's init-shaped line (claude `system/init
//! session_id`, codex `thread.started thread_id`, gemini `init session_id`)
//! and the next spawn passes it back (`--resume <id>` / `exec resume <id>`).
//! All three verified LIVE on this machine 2026-08-09:
//!
//! - claude 2.1.226: `--print --resume <session_id>` continues the SAME
//!   session id (no fork); memory confirmed (pomegranate probe).
//! - gemini 0.54.4: `--resume <session_id>` works headless with `-p`;
//!   memory confirmed. (The top-level help only mentions index/"latest";
//!   the error text for a bad id names `--resume {uuid}` as supported.)
//! - codex 0.141.0: `exec resume <thread_id> --json` re-attaches the thread
//!   (same thread_id re-emitted). Memory could not be verified live — this
//!   machine's codex quota is exhausted until 2026-08-27 — so codex
//!   continuity rests on the CLI's documented resume contract.
//!
//! A DEAD resume target must not wedge the worker forever: a missing
//! claude session exits 1 emitting only an error `result` (no init), and a
//! missing gemini session exits 42 with no stream at all (both measured).
//! So: refs are only ever (re)captured from init-shaped lines, and a run
//! that was spawned WITH a resume ref, FAILED, and never emitted one is
//! taken as "the target is gone" — the ref is dropped (memory + sink) so
//! the next turn starts fresh instead of failing identically forever.
//! Refs persist in `_amux_conversations` via [`ConversationSink`]
//! (migration 0011), hydrated back at registration by backend::bootstrap,
//! so continuity survives a server restart.
