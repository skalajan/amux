//! WorkerEvent processing + turn tracking (RR-0065, Invariants 5/6/11/26/34).
//!
//! One processor task per worker with a live session: it subscribes to the
//! agent protocol's event stream and turns every `WorkerEvent` into durable
//! state — a `_amux_turns` ledger row, a worker-state write, a command
//! transition — inside ONE `Store::write_async` transaction per event, so
//! every consequence of an event shares a revision and SSE sees it within
//! one event cycle (Invariant 11: stale worker state is a bug, and a state
//! that changed without an event is unsyncable).
//!
//! The confirmation contract (Invariant 34, delivery step 5): the pump marks
//! a command `Delivered` when the protocol acks receipt; `TurnCompleted` is
//! what proves the worker actually ACTED on it, so this module — not the
//! pump — performs the `Delivered -> Confirmed` transition. A command still
//! `Dispatched` at turn end is deliberately NOT confirmed: the protocol
//! never acked receipt, so a completed turn proves nothing about it; the
//! retry/timeout path (RR-0064) owns that case.
//!
//! Lagged broadcast receives log the missed count (Invariant 26): the event
//! channel is lossy by contract ("drop oldest, gap marker"), and a consumer
//! that cannot see the size of its gap is a consumer that will trust an
//! event-derived picture with a hole in it. Recovery is NOT attempted from
//! the stream — per Invariant 34 the correct move after a gap is to re-read
//! current state from the store, which the next full event write does.
