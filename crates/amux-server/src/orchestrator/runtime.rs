//! Orchestrator runtime (RR-0041, Invariants 9, 10, 11) + FleetProgress
//! heartbeat (Lesson L4).
//!
//! Drives the pure planner (`amux_core::orchestrator::plan_tick`) on an
//! interval, executes its plan against the store, and reconciles DB state
//! against backend reality at startup. Task assembly arrives with the board
//! API (Phase 2, RR-0049) — until then the planner runs over an empty task
//! list, which still exercises lease reclaim and the heartbeat.
