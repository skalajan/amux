//! Typed command/event protocol and pure command-queue semantics (RR-0006,
//! Invariants 5 and 34).
//!
//! Invariant 5 is the D1 exit: the terminal is an adapter, not the control
//! plane. The orchestrator speaks [`WorkerCommand`] down and [`WorkerEvent`]
//! up; whether an event came from a structured hook or a terminal scrape is
//! the adapter's secret, and the consumer never knows. Note
//! `DeliverMessage(MessageId)`, NOT `Steer(String)`: messages are durable
//! entities (Invariant 29), so the command carries a reference to the durable
//! row, never the payload — the Python system lost pending steering text on
//! every restart precisely because the text lived in the command.
//!
//! Invariant 34: every queue has an explicit delivery contract. Everything
//! here is pure — [`next_state`] is a function of (state, transition,
//! attempts), so the contract (Queued -> Dispatched -> Delivered ->
//! Confirmed; Failed from any pre-Confirmed state; retry until exhaustion,
//! then DeadLettered) is testable with no backend, no DB, and no clock. The
//! server persists [`QueuedCommand`] rows and drives them through this
//! machine; a dead letter is a system failure and gets a `DurableEvent`
//! (Invariant 24) at the persistence layer, not here.
//!
//! Per-worker event SEQUENCING (gap detection) is deliberately not on
//! [`WorkerEvent`]: causal ordering is a property of the event channel, so
//! the transport wraps events in its own envelope. Core defines what
//! happened, not how it travelled.
