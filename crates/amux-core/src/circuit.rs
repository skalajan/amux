//! Fleet-level circuit breakers (Invariants 48 + 45 + 10, RR-0028h).
//!
//! Per-task limits ([`crate::limits`], Invariant 47) stop one task from
//! thrashing; this module stops the FLEET: spend rate, progress rate, error
//! rate, and the every-item-blocked terminal event are watched at fleet
//! grain, and tripping any of them halts new assignments.
//!
//! **The critical interaction (Invariant 10 + 48):** the no-stall guarantee
//! calls an idle worker with runnable tasks a system failure — but a tripped
//! breaker DELIBERATELY produces idle workers with runnable tasks; that is
//! its job. Without [`stall_check_enabled`] returning `false` during
//! `CircuitOpen` AND `Reconciling`, the stall-fixer would fight the breaker:
//! the breaker halts, the stall check restarts, forever — a livelock in
//! which the emergency brake is the thing burning tokens. The no-stall
//! invariant is SUSPENDED while the circuit is open.
//!
//! `AllItemsBlocked` is the single owner of the "every remaining item is
//! blocked" terminal event (shared with Invariant 45's agent loop, which
//! enters reconciliation here rather than producing its own competing
//! terminal report — one owner, Invariant 36).
