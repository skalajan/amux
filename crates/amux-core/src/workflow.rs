//! The canonical board workflow: ordered, configurable columns (AMUX-2631).
//!
//! # The mismatch this resolves
//!
//! Before this module there were two disagreeing models of "what column is a
//! card in", and the disagreement was structural rather than a bug anyone could
//! point at:
//!
//! * the `statuses` TABLE — ordered, user-configurable, creatable, renamable,
//!   reorderable, with a per-column `gate` JSON. The API already ships
//!   `POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/board/statuses`, so users can build
//!   `todo -> implementation -> qa -> security-review -> verified` today.
//! * [`crate::board::TaskStatus`] — a CLOSED Rust enum, with the progression
//!   `Todo -> Doing -> Review -> Done -> Verified` written into the disposition
//!   logic, and `Gate.guards` pointing at it.
//!
//! Three consequences, all confirmed in the live tree before this landed:
//!
//! 1. **A card in a custom column is invisible to the orchestrator.**
//!    `board_store::to_task()` returns `Option<Task>` via `parse_status`, and
//!    `runtime::load_board_tasks` does `let Some(task) = row.to_task() else {
//!    continue }`. An unparseable column silently drops the card from planning
//!    entirely — no disposition, no next action, no assignment, no stall
//!    detection. Latent only because every status currently in production
//!    happens to parse; armed the moment anyone uses the custom-column feature
//!    the API already exposes.
//!
//! 2. **Configured column gates are ignored.** `effective_gate(row, target)`
//!    consults the row's own override then `default_gates_for(item_type,
//!    TaskStatus)` — a hardcoded match. `statuses.gate` is never read. Editing
//!    a column's gate through the UI writes the DB and changes nothing about
//!    enforcement. It looks correct today only because the seeded values are
//!    byte-identical to the hardcoded defaults — two subsystems agreeing by
//!    coincidence, which is the pattern that hides until someone edits one.
//!
//! 3. **Progression is hardcoded**, so `position` — the thing the reorder
//!    endpoint writes — does not actually determine what comes next.
//!
//! # The model
//!
//! Column IDENTITY is a durable string ([`ColumnId`]); column BEHAVIOUR is
//! typed ([`ColumnRole`], [`TerminalBehavior`]). That split is the whole point:
//! a user adds `security-review` without a Rust enum variant, while the
//! semantics that must stay typed — what is dispatchable, what is terminal and
//! whether terminal means success — remain in the type system where the
//! compiler can check them.
//!
//! Ordering comes from `position`. "Furthest right" is derived from the
//! configured order, never from a hardcoded sequence.
