//! Verification vocabulary: what proved a claim, and at what cost
//! (RR-0015; Invariants 7 and 28).
//!
//! Done is a worker's claim; Verified is the harness's conclusion (Invariant 7).
//! The types here are how that conclusion is reached and recorded:
//!
//! - [`VerifierKind`] — the single evaluation primitive, shared by gates
//!   (Invariant 18) and verification (Invariant 28). One spec, one evaluation
//!   path. There is deliberately NO `HumanReview` variant: capability policy
//!   replaces approval gates (Invariant 52) — nothing in the system blocks on a
//!   human pressing a button.
//! - [`Evidence`] — what a verification produced. Every piece carries its
//!   provenance ([`EvidenceSource`]), because three separate incidents
//!   (`8bc9eb3`, `7870384`, `9cd2892`) were verifications satisfied by output
//!   the verified actor produced itself. Evidence that cannot express WHO
//!   produced it is the "instrument cannot express the discriminator" failure
//!   (ethos rule 4) applied to verification.
//! - [`Verification`] / [`VerificationResult`] — the durable record and its
//!   verdict. `Failed` returns the task to in-progress via
//!   `board::BoardTransition::VerificationFailed` (Invariant 7).
//! - [`run_cheapest_first`] — the cost-ordered runner: free checks run first,
//!   and once a required free check fails, expensive verifiers are never
//!   invoked (Invariant 28: "if the free checks fail, expensive ones never
//!   run"). Never call a model when a deterministic check suffices.
//!
//! CORE IS PURE: nothing here executes a command, makes an HTTP call, or reads
//! a clock. `VerifierKind` is a *spec*; the server-side gate runner executes it
//! and feeds results back through the closure in [`run_cheapest_first`].
