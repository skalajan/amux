//! Append-only durable event history (RR-0009, Invariants 24 and 30).
//!
//! Every meaningful state mutation emits a [`DurableEvent`]. This is NOT
//! event sourcing — current state is still the DB row — it is the audit
//! trail: "why did AR-421 end up here?", replay for offline sync, metrics,
//! and the `why-blocked` query all read this stream. Invariant 30 splits the
//! world in two: structured events (this module) for machines, append-only
//! text logs for humans, correlated by the IDs in [`Correlation`].
//!
//! ## Immutability contract (Invariant 24)
//!
//! Events are append-only. The store enforces it physically (INSERT-only
//! table, no UPDATE/DELETE path); this module enforces it by SHAPE: there is
//! a constructor and there are no mutating methods — nothing in amux-core
//! edits an event after construction. Fields are `pub` for reading and for
//! serde, and Rust cannot forbid mutation of an owned value, so the contract
//! is documented here and enforced at the persistence boundary. An audit
//! trail that can be edited is worse than none, because it gets trusted
//! (ethos rule 6: the force-bypass that claimed "logged" and was not).
