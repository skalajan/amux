//! No-stall vocabulary (RR-0012; Invariant 10 — the cardinal acceptance
//! criterion).
//!
//! THE CARDINAL RULE: **a worker idle while any of its tasks is non-terminal
//! is a SYSTEM FAILURE.** Terminal states are `verified`, `archived`,
//! `discarded`, and `quarantined` — nothing else. (The plan explicitly
//! rejects a `blocked_by_user` terminal state: a terminal state with no
//! observer is where autonomous work goes to die. An external block is a
//! structured WAIT with a re-entry path, never an end state.)
//!
//! Every non-terminal task must have exactly one of: a runnable next action,
//! a named actor responsible for the next action, or a structured wait
//! reason. "Nothing is driving this" is an impossible state to REPRESENT,
//! not a condition the stall detector discovers afterward. That is why this
//! module is two disjoint enums rather than one status string:
//!
//! - [`WaitingFor`] — legitimate, structured waits. A task in one of these is
//!   NOT stalled; the dashboard shows the reason inline and the orchestrator
//!   knows what unblocks it.
//! - [`StallReason`] — system failures. Each variant is a bug in the harness,
//!   not a state of the work.
//!
//! The type-level separation is the point: `TreeConflict` living in
//! `WaitingFor` and not in `StallReason` is what makes "a dirty shared tree
//! got reported as a stall" unrepresentable (Invariant 33 / RR-0028k), and a
//! wrong classification is detectable from the serialized data itself
//! (ethos rule 4 — the tag names which enum the state came from).
