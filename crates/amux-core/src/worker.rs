//! Worker: the durable entity (RR-0003, RR-0018; Invariants 1, 43).
//!
//! A worker survives crashes, context exhaustion, renames, and server
//! restarts. Sessions come and go underneath it (Invariant 1); configuration
//! changes freely on top of it (Invariant 43). The one thing that never
//! changes is `WorkerId` — tasks, messages, memory, turn history, and the
//! backend process name (`session::backend_ref`) all hang off it, so mutating
//! it would orphan everything the worker has ever done.
//!
//! RR-0018 lives here too: classifying a config change into how it is applied
//! (Immediate / NextTurn / SessionRestart) and reporting the outcome, so the
//! API can tell the caller truthfully what happened — including whether a
//! session was replaced (ethos rule 6: report the swap, don't just do it).
