//! Message as a durable entity (RR-0010, Invariant 29).
//!
//! Steering messages, `@worker` mentions, task discussion, and offline
//! commands are all the same thing: a Message. Making it a durable entity —
//! not command plumbing — gives threads, delivery tracking, search, and
//! audit history without building each separately, and it is why
//! `WorkerCommand::DeliverMessage(MessageId)` carries a REFERENCE: the text
//! lives here, in a store that survives restarts. The Python system lost
//! pending steering text on every restart because the text lived in the
//! delivery pipe.
//!
//! Delivery state moves FORWARD ONLY (Queued -> Delivered -> Acknowledged ->
//! ActedOn). A backwards move would be rewriting delivery history, and the
//! delivery record is part of the audit trail (Invariant 24's spirit applied
//! to messages: 2026-07-27, a delivered message was reported as swallowed —
//! the delivery record is what settles that argument, so it must not be
//! editable backwards).
