//! Memory as a durable, scoped, revisioned entity (Invariant 42, RR-0014).
//!
//! The largest architectural gap the Python commit history exposes: canonical
//! memory lived in files, a generated projection (MEMORY.md, a compacted
//! summary) got read back as canonical, and old generated data overwrote
//! newer source — or two workers wrote through one shared file and the last
//! writer won. The fix is structural, not procedural: `MemoryEntry` is the
//! canonical entity, everything else (search index, worker context, compacted
//! summary, MEMORY.md) is a derived, read-only projection (Invariant 39) that
//! never writes back without an explicit user mutation.
//!
//! Two properties carry the invariant:
//! - **Soft delete.** `deleted_at` is a timestamp, never a row removal —
//!   history is never lost, and a delete is as attributable as a write.
//! - **One scope resolver.** Visibility flows through
//!   [`Scope::applies_to`](crate::scope::Scope::applies_to) (Invariant 2),
//!   never a per-subsystem re-implementation — re-implemented inheritance is
//!   how the Python system's env, gate, and memory scoping came to disagree.
