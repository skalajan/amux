//! AMUX-2672: a bare `amux-rs <verb>` must reach the server that is running.
//!
//! The default was `https://localhost:8823`, the port the Rust server used while
//! Python owned 8822. Python retired, the Rust server took over 8822 AND 8824,
//! and nothing has listened on 8823 since — so every bare invocation died on
//! connect. The failure mode is what made it expensive: a connection error looks
//! exactly like the server being down, so the CLI's own misconfiguration reads as
//! a server fault (it cost a wrong diagnosis on AMUX-2653).
//!
//! It then moved 8822 -> 8824 (2026-08-10): 8822 is the RETIRED address, alive
//! only via a countdown bind for pre-cutover processes, so defaulting there was
//! the same bug with a later expiry date. 8824 is what install.sh configures.
//!
//! HONEST LIMIT of the two `err.is_empty() ||` assertions below: on a machine
//! where the server is up, `health` succeeds and stderr is empty, so they pass
//! without testing the port. That is deliberate (they must not fail in CI, where
//! nothing is listening) but it means they are not the guard against the default
//! regressing. `crates/amux-server/tests/legacy_port_guard.rs` is — it reads the
//! constant out of the source and fails on the literal, listening or not.
//!
//! End-to-end rather than unit, because the bug was in the wiring — `resolve_url`
//! could be perfect and the arg still bound to the wrong default.
