# amux Rust Rebuild Plan

Rewrite of `amux-server.py` (77k-line Python single-file server) in Rust. Not a port
-- a redesign that makes the implicit architecture explicit.

## What exists today

| Layer | Lines | % of file |
|---|---|---|
| Dashboard SPA (inline HTML/CSS/JS) | ~44,300 | 57% |
| Python server (HTTP, API, jobs, integrations) | ~32,700 | 43% |

- **77,050 lines**, single file, hand-rolled `BaseHTTPRequestHandler`
- **SQLite tables** (actual count discovered by RR-0117), single DB file per tenant
- **212 API routes** (250+ method/path combos)
- **~30 background jobs** (scheduler, snapshots, rate-limit watchdog, steering, token ledger, email sync, etc.)
- **3 terminal backends**: herdr (primary process host), tmux, iTerm2
- **Structured agent protocol**: OpenCode (structured commands, events, lifecycle)
- **4 LLM providers**: Claude Code (OAuth + API key), Gemini, Codex, Ollama
- **Full SPA dashboard** with revisioned SSE, delta sync, PWA/offline, dark/light themes

## Why Rust

1. **Real concurrency**: Python's GIL serializes 30+ background jobs on a ThreadingHTTPServer. Rust gives async + multi-threading with no global lock.
2. **Type-enforced invariants**: the new architecture has explicit scopes, typed commands/events, and state machines. A type system makes these compile-time guarantees, not runtime hopes.
3. **Memory**: Python's per-object overhead on a 24/7 desktop server alongside 40+ workers.
4. **Single binary**: one artifact to deploy, no venv or lazy imports.

## The central insight: amux is an orchestrator, not a session manager

The existing system describes itself as a "session manager." That is wrong. amux is an
**orchestrator that uses workers to drive work to completion.** The difference matters
because it determines where every architectural boundary falls.

The Python server has an implicit orchestrator scattered across pickup.rs, advance-nudge,
steering, snapshot, gates, and session startup. Making it explicit is the single biggest
architectural change in this rewrite.

## System invariants (define before building)

### Invariant 1: Worker != Session != Backend

A **worker** is a durable amux entity with identity, configuration, capabilities, and
state that survives crashes, context exhaustion, and server restarts.

A **session** is an execution instance: a running process inside a terminal backend,
owned by a worker. A worker may have many sessions over its lifetime (crash -> restart,
context exhaustion -> new session, explicit restart).

A **backend** is the process host: herdr, tmux, native PTY, or anything else. It
spawns, persists, captures, and provides terminal access -- but does not observe or
decide. Structured agent semantics (commands, events, lifecycle state) come from
**OpenCode**, not from the backend.

```
Worker (durable entity)
 ├── Session 1 (ran, hit context limit, ended)
 ├── Session 2 (ran, crashed via OOM, ended)
 └── Session 3 (currently running)
       └── Backend: herdr agent "amux-wrk_01J..."
```

```rust
struct Worker {
    id: WorkerId,                    // immutable, e.g. wrk_01J...
    display_name: String,            // mutable, user-facing
    name_aliases: Vec<String>,       // old names still resolve (for @worker mentions)
    group: Option<GroupId>,
    config: WorkerConfig,
    capabilities: WorkerCapabilities,
    state: WorkerState,
    version: u64,                    // entity version (Invariant 35)
}

struct Session {
    id: SessionId,
    worker_id: WorkerId,
    backend: BackendId,           // open string, not closed enum (Invariant 8)
    process: Option<ProcessRef>,
    started_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    ended_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    exit_reason: Option<ExitReason>,
}
```

Backend process identifiers derive from immutable `WorkerId`, not display name:
`format!("amux-{}", worker.id)`. Renaming a worker (`backend` -> `rust-backend`)
changes its display name instantly without affecting its backend reference,
process identity, or any durable state. Old names become aliases so `@backend`
still resolves after renaming to `@rust-backend` (Invariant 17).

### Invariant 2: Four-tier scope with deterministic inheritance

Everything configurable lives at one of four scopes:
**Org -> Global -> Group -> Worker**. Worker overrides Group overrides Global
overrides Org. This applies uniformly to:

- Environment variables
- Board column definitions and gates
- Memories / instructions
- Model / runtime configuration
- Schedules
- Permissions
- Integrations (MCP servers, tools)
- Automation behavior (auto-compact, auto-restart, pickup)
- Capability policies (Invariant 52)

One resolver, used everywhere:

```rust
enum Scope {
    Org(OrgId),
    Global,
    Group(GroupId),
    Worker(WorkerId),
}

fn effective_config<T: Mergeable>(
    org: Option<&T>,
    global: &T,
    group: Option<&T>,
    worker: &T,
) -> T {
    let mut effective = match org {
        Some(o) => o.clone(),
        None => T::default(),
    };
    effective.merge(global);  // global overrides org
    if let Some(g) = group {
        effective.merge(g);   // group overrides global
    }
    effective.merge(worker);  // worker overrides group
    effective
}
```

`Org` is the outermost tier. In single-tenant (personal) mode, there is one
implicit org and the resolver collapses to three tiers. In multi-tenant (cloud)
mode, `OrgId` threads through every ID, every query, every index, and every SSE
stream. Adding it retroactively means touching every query and index -- do it now.
Scope revisions are per-org in multi-tenant mode.

Do NOT implement environment inheritance separately from memory inheritance separately
from gate inheritance. Scope resolution is a primitive.

### Invariant 3: Board is the system of record for all work

The board is not a visualization layer. It is the canonical state of what work exists,
who owns it, and where it is in its lifecycle. Every status transition goes through
the board's transactional state machine. No work happens off-board.

```rust
enum BoardTransition {
    Create { title: String, item_type: ItemType },
    Claim { worker_id: WorkerId, lease: Lease },
    Start,
    Submit,
    RequestReview { reviewer: Actor },
    Approve,
    Reject { reason: String },
    Complete { evidence: Vec<Evidence> },
    Verify { criteria: Vec<Criterion>, evidence: Vec<Evidence> },
    Force { status: Status, reason: String },
    Archive { reason: String },
    Restore { reason: String },
}

// Every transition: one function, one code path, audited by construction
fn apply_transition(
    item: &Task,
    tx: BoardTransition,
    actor: &Actor,
    scope: &EffectiveConfig,  // gates come from scope
) -> Result<Task, GateError>;
```

Gates are scoped: global gates apply to all groups, group gates override for that
group, worker-level gates can further specialize. A group might require code review
while another group does not.

### Invariant 4: Board tasks form a dependency graph

Issues have typed relations:

```rust
enum TaskRelation {
    Blocks,
    DependsOn,
    Parent,
    Child,
    Related,
    Verifies,
}
```

"Runnable" is derived centrally from the graph:

```
A ──┬──> C
B ──┘
A and B can run concurrently; C cannot start until both are done.
```

The orchestrator uses this graph to determine what to assign, not a flat queue scan.

### Invariant 5: Typed command/event protocol (the D1 exit)

The terminal is an adapter, not the control plane. The system speaks typed commands
and events internally via **OpenCode's structured agent protocol**. Prompts,
messages, cancellation, and lifecycle queries go through OpenCode directly --
never routed through the backend. The backend (herdr, tmux, or native PTY)
handles only process hosting: start, stop, inspect. This separation eliminates
most scraping entirely.

```rust
enum WorkerCommand {
    ExecuteTask(TaskId),
    Continue,
    DeliverMessage(MessageId),
    Verify(TaskId),
    Review(TaskId),
    Cancel,      // DeliveryTiming::Immediate
    Pause,       // DeliveryTiming::Immediate
    Resume,      // DeliveryTiming::Immediate
}

enum WorkerEvent {
    Started,
    TurnStarted { turn_id: TurnId },
    Progress(ProgressReport),
    Waiting(WaitReason),
    ToolUsed(ToolEvent),
    TaskUpdated(TaskId),
    TurnCompleted(TurnResult),
    RateLimited(RateLimit),
    ContextLow(u8),
    BudgetWarning { model: ModelId, utilization: f32 },
    BudgetPaused { model: ModelId, spent: f64, limit: BudgetLimit },
    BudgetRaised { model: ModelId, old_limit: BudgetLimit, new_limit: BudgetLimit },
    Failed(Failure),
    Exited(ExitStatus),
}
```

When Claude Code hooks fire, they emit `WorkerEvent` variants directly. When hooks
don't cover something, the terminal scraper infers a `WorkerEvent` from the captured
text. The consumer never knows which source produced the event -- it just processes
`WorkerEvent`s. As structured coverage grows, scrapers shrink to liveness checks.

RR-0030 live evidence: Claude Code emits `rate_limit_event` and Codex CLI emits
`error`/`turn.failed` for usage limits in their structured streams (events.rs).
Gemini CLI rate limits remain terminal-scrape-only. Claude Code's interactive
rate-limit MENU is still terminal-only.

This is the actual D1 exit. Backend scraping becomes a fallback adapter that emits
`WorkerEvent::RateLimited` instead of the orchestrator matching regexes. OpenCode's
structured agent protocol handles most transitions directly; scraping remains only
for provider-specific signals (rate-limit messages, context warnings) that neither
OpenCode nor provider hooks expose.

### Invariant 6: Turn is a first-class concept

A turn is one cycle of a worker's execution: it starts when the worker begins
processing, ends when it yields (waiting for input, rate-limited, idle, done).

```rust
struct Turn {
    id: TurnId,
    session_id: SessionId,
    task_id: Option<TaskId>,
    started_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    ended_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    outcome: Option<TurnOutcome>,
    events: Vec<WorkerEvent>,
}
```

Turn boundaries are where:
- Steering messages are delivered
- Board consequences are evaluated
- Memory is refreshed
- State snapshots are taken
- Orchestrator decisions happen

Without an explicit turn, "turn boundary" is a collection of heuristics.

### Invariant 7: Done != Verified

Done is a worker's claim. Verified is the harness's conclusion.

```rust
struct Verification {
    task_id: TaskId,
    verifier: Actor,
    criteria: Vec<Criterion>,
    evidence: Vec<Evidence>,
    result: VerificationResult,
    verified_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}

enum VerificationResult {
    Passed,
    Failed { reason: String },  // -> task returns to InProgress
}
```

A task moves `done -> verified` only when ALL applicable layers pass:

1. **Implementation**: code compiles, no warnings, clippy clean
2. **Unit tests**: all relevant unit tests pass
3. **Integration tests**: all relevant integration tests pass
4. **Backend conformance**: HerdrBackend and TmuxBackend pass conformance suite
   where applicable (Invariant 21)
5. **Provider conformance**: provider adapters pass conformance suite where
   applicable (Invariant 21)
6. **API**: endpoint returns correct response shapes, status codes, error bodies
7. **CLI**: command produces correct output and side effects
8. **Browser UI**: Playwright verifies the feature renders, is interactive, and
   produces correct results -- DOM existence alone is NOT sufficient
9. **Visual/rendering**: nonzero bounding boxes, no clipping, correct stacking,
   usable touch targets, mobile geometry (Invariant 44)
10. **Persistence/restart**: create/mutate -> stop server -> restart -> reconcile ->
    read through API/CLI/UI -> verify unchanged/correct
11. **Migration of existing data**: Python-era data loads and works correctly
12. **Creation of net-new data**: fresh data through Rust system works correctly
13. **Offline behavior**: applicable mutations work offline and replay correctly
14. **Sync/reconciliation**: SSE events, delta sync, gap detection, convergence
15. **Audit/event provenance**: DurableEvent emitted with correct actor, timestamp,
    correlation IDs
16. **Searchability**: entity appears in universal search (Invariant 32)
17. **Performance**: meets target latency/memory constraints

Not every layer applies to every item, but the Execution Checklist (§Execution
Checklist) must state which layers are applicable for each item. The implementation
agent may never mark a UI-facing capability verified based only on unit tests, API
tests, DOM existence, code inspection, or a worker claiming success. For user-facing
functionality, browser verification is required.

This is what distinguishes amux from "workers with a kanban board."

### Invariant 8: Provider agnosticism

amux orchestrates work. The model runtime is pluggable:

```rust
// Providers and backends are registry-resolved by string ID, not closed enums.
// Adding a new provider or backend requires no recompilation of amux-core.

struct ProviderId(String);    // "claude-code", "gemini", "codex", "ollama", etc.
struct BackendId(String);     // "herdr", "tmux", "native-pty", etc.

struct ProviderConfig {
    id: ProviderId,
    auth: Value,              // provider-specific auth config (JSON)
    capabilities: ProviderCapabilities,
}

struct ProviderCapabilities {
    supports_opencode: bool,
    supports_hooks: bool,
    rate_limit_pattern: Option<Regex>,
    prompt_detection: PromptDetection,
}

struct WorkerConfig {
    cwd: PathBuf,                    // process working directory
    provider: ProviderId,
    provider_config: ProviderConfig,
    model: Option<ModelId>,
    backend: BackendId,              // default: "herdr"
    environment: ScopedEnv,
    permissions: Permissions,
    // ...
}
// All fields are mutable without changing WorkerId (Invariant 43).
```

Providers and backends are registered at startup from config, not compiled in.
The provider registry maps `ProviderId` -> `ProviderConfig` +
`Box<dyn ProviderTrait>`. Adding a provider means implementing the trait and
registering it -- no changes to `amux-core`.

Every provider needs:
- A way to start a session (CLI invocation differs per provider)
- A way to detect its rate-limit patterns (different regexes per provider)
- A way to detect its prompt/idle state

Provider-specific logic lives in provider modules, not in `if provider == "gemini"`
branches scattered everywhere.

### Invariant 9: Idempotent + at-least-once for all orchestration

Rust's concurrency makes latent races easier to trigger. Every consequential
operation gets an idempotency key.

```rust
struct WorkAssignment {
    task_id: TaskId,
    worker_id: WorkerId,
    attempt: u32,
    lease: Lease,
    context: WorkContext,
    idempotency_key: Uuid,
    prior_attempts: Vec<AttemptRecord>,  // mandatory for attempt > 1 (Invariant 49)
    execution_limits: ExecutionLimits,   // anti-livelock (Invariant 47)
}

struct Lease {
    acquired_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    expires_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    generation: u64,
}
```

Claiming is atomic: `UPDATE tasks SET status='claimed', worker_id=?, generation=?
WHERE id=? AND status='todo' AND generation=?`. Exactly one claimant.

Dead workers: lease expires -> task becomes runnable again. No manual intervention.

Startup reconciliation:

```rust
async fn reconcile_on_startup(ctx: &AppContext) {
    // DB says running + backend says missing -> mark interrupted, restart
    // Backend exists + DB says stopped -> adopt or kill
    // Task claimed + lease expired -> release, requeue
    // Pending steering message -> redeliver
    // Schedule fire persisted but execution missing -> retry
}
```

### Invariant 10: No-stall guarantee (the cardinal acceptance criterion)

**If a worker is idle and any of its tasks are not in a terminal state, that is a
system failure.** Terminal states are: `verified`, `archived`, `discarded`, and
`quarantined`. Everything else must keep moving. There is no `blocked_by_user` --
a terminal state with no observer is where autonomous work goes to die. External
blocks carry a machine-checkable `VerifierKind` condition and a `retry_at`
timestamp; they re-enter the runnable set when the check passes.

**Every non-terminal task must have exactly one of: a runnable next action, a named
actor responsible for the next action, or a structured wait reason.** "Nothing is
driving this" is an impossible state, not a thing the stall detector discovers
afterward.

```rust
enum TerminalStatus {
    Verified,
    Archived,
    Discarded,
    Quarantined {       // exhausted retries, decomposition failed (Invariant 47)
        failure_chain: Vec<AttemptRecord>,
        quarantined_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
}

enum WaitingFor {
    Dependency(TaskId),
    Gate { gate: GateId, missing: Vec<GateCriterion> },
    BlockedExternal {   // replaces BlockedByUser -- must carry re-entry condition
        condition: VerifierKind,
        retry_at: DateTime<Utc>,
        description: String,
    },
    Provider { kind: WaitReason },
    ExternalCondition { description: String, check: VerifierKind },
    Capability { needed: Vec<String>, available_workers: Vec<WorkerId> },
    TreeConflict {      // dirty tree or merge conflict under Shared isolation
        holder: WorkerId,
        path: PathBuf,
    },
}

// Every non-terminal task resolves to exactly one of these:
enum TaskDisposition {
    Runnable,                            // can be picked up now
    Assigned { worker: WorkerId },       // someone is working on it
    Waiting(WaitingFor),                 // blocked, with structured reason
    Terminal(TerminalStatus),            // done, nothing to do
}

fn disposition(task: &Task, board: &Board) -> TaskDisposition {
    // This function must be total -- every task resolves to one variant.
    // If none of the conditions match, that is a compile-time error
    // (exhaustive match), not a runtime discovery.
}

// The orchestrator runs this check on every tick:
fn stall_check(worker: &Worker, board: &Board, fleet: &FleetState) -> Vec<StallViolation> {
    // Invariant 48: circuit breaker deliberately produces idle workers with
    // runnable tasks. Stall check is suspended during fleet emergency.
    if matches!(fleet, FleetState::CircuitOpen { .. } | FleetState::Reconciling) {
        return vec![];
    }
    if worker.state != WorkerState::Idle { return vec![]; }
    board.tasks_for_worker(worker.id)
        .filter(|i| matches!(disposition(i, board), TaskDisposition::Runnable))
        .map(|i| StallViolation {
            worker_id: worker.id,
            task_id: i.id,
            status: i.status,
            idle_since: worker.idle_since,
        })
        .collect()
}
```

When the orchestrator detects a stall:
1. If the worker is rate-limited: wait (not idle, not a stall)
2. If the task is blocked by a dependency: no stall (it is `Waiting(Dependency(...))`)
3. If the task is waiting on a gate: no stall (it is `Waiting(Gate(...))`)
4. If the worker has no runnable tasks left in its scope: reassign the worker to a
   different scope or mark it idle (an idle worker with zero runnable tasks is not a
   stall -- it is correct)
5. Otherwise: the worker MUST be given the task and told to continue

The dashboard shows `WaitingFor` inline on every non-terminal, non-assigned task.
A user looking at the board sees exactly WHY each item is waiting, not just that it
is stuck. `TaskDisposition::Waiting` with no resolution path (e.g., waiting on a
capability no worker has) triggers an escalation alert.

This is tested in every Playwright golden scenario: at the end of every test, assert
that no worker is idle with runnable tasks. A stall is a CI failure.

### Invariant 11: Worker state is always current

The current system's worker status (idle, working, rate-limited, etc.) is frequently
stale because it depends on polling terminal output. The Rust system treats stale
status as a bug.

Worker state transitions are event-driven, not poll-derived:

```rust
// Every WorkerEvent updates state immediately
fn process_event(worker: &mut Worker, event: WorkerEvent) {
    match event {
        WorkerEvent::TurnStarted { .. } => worker.state = WorkerState::Active,
        WorkerEvent::TurnCompleted(_) => worker.state = WorkerState::Idle { since: now() },
        WorkerEvent::Waiting(reason) => worker.state = WorkerState::Waiting(reason),
        WorkerEvent::RateLimited(rl) => worker.state = WorkerState::RateLimited {
            kind: rl.kind,
            reset_at: rl.reset_at,
            provider: rl.provider,
        },
        WorkerEvent::ContextLow(pct) => worker.context_pct = Some(pct),
        WorkerEvent::BudgetPaused { model, .. } => {
            worker.state = WorkerState::Waiting(WaitReason::BudgetExhausted { model });
        }
        WorkerEvent::BudgetRaised { .. } => {
            worker.state = WorkerState::Idle { since: now() };
        }
        WorkerEvent::Failed(_) => worker.state = WorkerState::Error,
        WorkerEvent::Exited(_) => worker.state = WorkerState::Stopped,
        _ => {}
    }
    // DB write increments global rev; SSE carries the revisioned StateEvent
    // Dashboard applies only if rev > local rev (Invariant 35)
    db.persist_worker_state(worker)?;
    emit_state_event(worker.id, EntityType::Worker, Mutation::StateChanged);
}
```

Event sources, in priority order:
1. **OpenCode structured protocol**: typed agent lifecycle events (turn start/end,
   waiting, completion, context state) reported directly as WorkerEvents
2. **Provider hooks** (Claude Code): events in real time via Stop/UserPromptSubmit
3. **Terminal adapter** (fallback): polls and translates rendered terminal output to
   WorkerEvents for provider-specific signals OpenCode/hooks cannot expose

The consumer code is identical regardless of source. OpenCode handles structured
lifecycle transitions for all providers; the terminal adapter handles only
provider-specific rate-limit patterns.

**Per-provider event coverage** (what each source can report):

| Event | OpenCode | Claude (hooks) | Terminal scrape |
|---|---|---|---|
| TurnStarted | structured event | UserPromptSubmit hook | regex (fallback) |
| TurnCompleted | structured event | Stop hook | regex (fallback) |
| Waiting/Blocked | structured event | -- | regex (fallback) |
| RateLimited | Claude: rate_limit_event; Codex: error/turn.failed | -- | Gemini + Claude menu (fallback) |
| ContextLow | structured event | -- | regex (fallback) |
| Failed (crash) | structured event | -- | process check (fallback) |

OpenCode provides lifecycle events for all providers. Provider hooks complement
for provider-specific signals. Terminal scraping is the fallback for signals
neither OpenCode nor hooks cover (primarily rate-limit patterns).

**Acceptance test**: dashboard shows correct worker status within 2s of every state
change. Tested for all 4 providers.

### Invariant 12: Groups are first-class (not tags)

Groups replace the tag-based isolation system. A group is a structural boundary, not
a label.

```rust
struct Group {
    id: GroupId,
    name: String,
    config: GroupConfig,  // overrides global
    gates: Vec<GateDefinition>,  // board column gates for this group
    columns: Vec<ColumnDefinition>,  // board columns (can differ per group)
    members: Vec<WorkerId>,
}
```

Every worker belongs to exactly one group (or the implicit global group). Groups
define their own board column names, column gates, environment, memories, schedules,
and automation behavior. The scope resolver (Invariant 2) makes this uniform.

Workers do NOT use tags for group membership. A worker's `group_id` is a foreign key,
not a string label.

### Invariant 13: API contract is the decoupling layer

The frontend (dashboard SPA) and backend communicate exclusively through a typed API
contract. This enables:
1. Swapping between Python and Rust backends during migration (phase 11)
2. Independent frontend development
3. Third-party integrations against a stable contract

Every API route has a documented contract:

```rust
// Example: POST /api/board
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
struct CreateTaskRequest {
    title: String,
    #[serde(default)]
    desc: Option<String>,
    #[serde(default = "default_status")]
    status: Status,
    #[serde(default)]
    item_type: Option<ItemType>,
    #[serde(default)]
    depends_on: Vec<TaskId>,
    #[serde(default)]
    tags: Vec<String>,
}

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
struct CreateTaskResponse {
    id: TaskId,
    title: String,
    status: Status,
    item_type: ItemType,
    worker: Option<String>,
    #[serde(skip_serializing_if = "field_style_is_modern")]
    session: Option<String>,  // legacy alias, same value as worker (Invariant 53)
    // ... all fields
}

// Gate rejection (409):
#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize, JsonSchema)]
struct GateRejection {
    error: String,  // "gate not acknowledged"
    ok: bool,       // false
    blocked: bool,  // true
    gate: Vec<String>,
    attempted_status: Status,
    item: TaskId,
    item_type: ItemType,
    how_to_ack: GateAckInstructions,
    cli: String,    // amux board command to satisfy
}
```

Phase 0 generates an OpenAPI spec from the `JsonSchema` derives. The Playwright tests
validate against the spec. The Python server's responses are validated against the same
spec during strangler-fig migration (phases 1-10).

### Invariant 14: Offline-first with optimistic sync

The dashboard is an offline-first PWA. All mutations are applied optimistically to
local state, persisted to IndexedDB, and synced to the server when connectivity is
available. This is not a fallback mode -- it is the primary architecture. The current
Python system already has offline queuing (localStorage + IndexedDB), service worker
caching, and an offline banner with manual sync. The Rust rebuild makes this the
foundation instead of a bolt-on.

#### Client-side architecture

```
User action
  -> apply to local state (instant UI update)
  -> persist to IndexedDB (survives tab close)
  -> enqueue sync operation
  -> attempt server sync
     -> success: confirm, reconcile with server state
     -> conflict: show resolution toast, keep local or accept server
     -> offline: queue for retry on reconnect
```

```typescript
// IndexedDB stores (idb-keyval or Dexie):
interface QueuedOperation {
  id: string;              // idempotency key (uuid)
  method: string;          // POST, PATCH, DELETE
  path: string;            // /api/board/AR-7
  body?: any;              // JSON payload
  baseRev: number;         // entity version at time of queue (for conflict detection)
  queuedAt: number;        // timestamp
  retries: number;         // retry count
  lastError?: string;      // last sync error
  optimisticState?: any;   // local state applied before server confirmed
}
```

IndexedDB also persists the `EntityStore` from Invariant 35 (the normalized
client-side cache). This is the offline rendering source. `lastRev` in the
store drives delta sync on reconnect: `GET /api/sync?since_rev={lastRev}`.

#### Server-side support

All server-side sync, conflict detection, and delta reconciliation is defined
in Invariant 35 (server-authoritative revisioned state). The offline layer
uses those primitives:

- **Optimistic writes** include `base_rev` (entity version); conflicts return
  409 with current server state (Invariant 35)
- **Delta sync** on reconnect uses `GET /api/sync?since_rev=N` (Invariant 35)
- **Idempotency keys** on queued operations prevent duplicate application
  (Invariant 9)

#### Conflict resolution

Conflicts are surfaced, never swallowed:

| Conflict type | Resolution |
|---|---|
| Board card moved by someone else while offline | Toast with both states, server wins (latest rev) |
| Board card deleted while offline edit queued | Toast: "card was deleted", discard edit |
| Worker command sent while worker stopped | Toast: "worker stopped", offer restart |
| Entity version conflict (409) | Show server state, server wins, re-apply local intent on new base |

#### Service worker caching

The SW caches the app shell (HTML/CSS/JS), icons, manifest, and the last-known
server state. On startup:
1. Serve cached shell immediately (instant paint)
2. Fetch fresh state in background
3. If offline, render from IndexedDB cache
4. Reconnect triggers delta sync, not full reload

Cache invalidation: `APP_VER` stamp in the SW. Server bumps it on deploy. SW
detects new version, fetches new shell, activates on next navigation. The current
Python system requires manually bumping `APP_VER` and `CACHE` in sw.js together --
the Rust build stamps both from `build.rs`.

#### Prefetch for deep offline

The current "Save all workers for offline" button prefetches worker peek/history
for all workers. The Rust version:
- Background sync: if the device has been online for 30s and battery > 20%,
  prefetch worker states incrementally (one per second, not all at once)
- Configurable: policy determines which workers to cache for offline (default: all active)
- Storage budget: IndexedDB size limit awareness (show usage, prune old data)

**Test plan** (offline-specific; real-time convergence tests are in Invariant 35):
- Playwright: go offline, create board card, send worker command, go online, verify
  both applied with correct base_rev
- Playwright: go offline, queue 5 commands, go online, verify all 5 replay in order
- Playwright: offline queue + entity version conflict (409) shows toast with both states
- Playwright: dashboard renders all tabs from service worker cache while offline
- Playwright: close tab while offline with queued operations, reopen, verify queue
  survives in IndexedDB and replays on reconnect
- Playwright: service worker update -- deploy new version, verify client picks up
  new shell on next navigation without losing queued operations
- Playwright: deep offline -- prefetch 10 workers, go offline, navigate to each
  worker's detail, verify peek/history renders from cache

### Invariant 15: Three cardinal rules

Elevated from lessons learned to architectural law:

1. **No LLM invocation unless the operation requires semantic judgment.** Title
   derivation, label generation, string formatting, gate evaluation, scope resolution,
   context assembly, dependency resolution -- all deterministic, all free. The token
   cost metric (tokens per verified task) is a first-class dashboard number alongside
   latency, CPU, and RSS.

2. **No state transition without durable provenance.** Every mutation emits an
   append-only event with actor, timestamp, and cause. Provenance is queryable:
   `amux task AR-123 history` returns the full chain.

3. **No backend/provider-specific behavior above its adapter boundary.** The
   orchestrator, board, scheduler, and dashboard never know whether herdr, tmux, or
   native PTY is hosting the process, or whether Claude or Ollama is the provider.
   If a feature requires `if backend == "herdr"` or `if provider == "claude"` above
   the adapter, the adapter's interface is wrong.

### Invariant 16: Token budgets are a runtime primitive

Not just a context-assembler concern. Budgets govern context assembly, turn execution,
task-level cost tracking, and **per-worker model spend limits**.

```rust
struct TokenBudget {
    max_input: u32,
    reserved_output: u32,
    max_per_task: Option<u64>,
    max_per_turn: Option<u32>,
}

struct ContextFragment {
    source: ContextSource,
    priority: u8,
    estimated_tokens: u32,
    content_hash: Hash,
}
```

Context assembly is deterministic priority order:

`task + acceptance criteria > immediate dependencies > relevant memory > recent turns > broad history`

Never dump entire task graphs, logs, memories, or prior transcripts. Summarize/cache
once, reference by ID/hash, hydrate on demand. **Tokens consumed per verified task**
is a core metric on the dashboard.

#### Per-worker model budgets

Every worker can have spend limits scoped by model. This is the local enforcement
layer; for providers that support session-level budgets natively (Managed Agents
`budget_reached` event), amux sets the provider-side budget AND tracks locally.
For providers without native budget support (Ollama, Codex CLI), amux enforces
via its own token accounting.

```rust
struct WorkerModelBudget {
    model: ModelId,
    window: BudgetWindow,
    limit: BudgetLimit,
    spent: f64,
    state: BudgetState,
}

enum BudgetWindow {
    Rolling { hours: u32 },   // e.g., 4h rolling
    Daily,                    // resets at UTC midnight
    Weekly,
    Monthly,
    Total,                    // lifetime, no reset
}

enum BudgetLimit {
    Tokens(u64),
    Cost { currency: String, amount: f64 },
}

enum BudgetState {
    Active,
    Warning { utilization: f32 },   // e.g., 80% threshold
    Paused { reached_at: DateTime<Utc> },
    Raised { old_limit: BudgetLimit, new_limit: BudgetLimit },
}
```

Scoped via Invariant 2 (Org/Global/Group/Worker). A group-level budget applies
to all workers in that group unless overridden per worker.

**Provider integration:**

- **Managed Agents** (Claude API): `start_session` passes `max_tokens` or
  `max_cost`. On `budget_reached` event, worker pauses. User can raise the
  budget via dashboard or CLI, which calls `update_session` to resume.
- **Subscription providers** (Claude Code, Gemini CLI): amux tracks via
  `SelfAccounting` (Invariant 24). Pause is local — amux stops sending
  commands when the budget is hit.
- **Local providers** (Ollama): tokens are effectively free but tracked.
  Budget defaults to `None` (unlimited). Can be set to catch runaway loops.

**Dashboard:** per-worker spend is visible in the worker detail panel and the
fleet-wide cost view. Budget warnings surface as `WorkerEvent::BudgetWarning`.
Budget exhaustion surfaces as `WorkerEvent::BudgetPaused` and blocks the
worker's command queue until raised.

### Invariant 17: Structural @worker addressing

Mentions are not prompt syntax. They are durable, addressed intent with delivery
tracking.

```rust
enum ActorRef {
    Worker(WorkerId),
    Group(GroupId),
    Orchestrator,
    User(UserId),
}

struct Mention {
    id: MentionId,
    actor: ActorRef,
    instruction: String,
    state: MentionState,
}

enum MentionState {
    Queued,
    Delivered { at: DateTime<Utc> },
    Acknowledged { at: DateTime<Utc> },
    ActedOn { outcome: String },
}
```

`@worker-3 investigate auth regression` parses into a durable command addressed to
worker-3. Works in task descriptions, comments, board activity, CLI, and dashboard.
Offline safe (queued -> delivered on reconnect). Crash safe (persisted in DB before
delivery attempt).

### Invariant 18: Gates are first-class entities

Gates are not just scoped definitions enforced by transitions. They are database
entities with APIs, history, versions, and explainability.

```rust
struct Gate {
    id: GateId,
    scope: Scope,
    transition: TransitionSelector,  // e.g., doing -> done
    criteria: Vec<Criterion>,
    verifier: VerifierKind,          // unified with Invariant 28 verification
    required_evidence: Vec<EvidenceType>,
}

// GateEvaluator is now VerifierKind (Invariant 28 + 52 merged).
// One spec, definable in config, used by both gates and verification.
// This eliminates the duplicate evaluation path.
//
// Gate evaluation order: Deterministic VerifierKinds run first (Command,
// HttpCheck, FileExists). ModelJudgment runs last and only if deterministic
// checks pass. This is enforced by the gate runner, not by the enum.
```

The critical query:

```
amux task AR-123 why-blocked

blocked by gate G-9 (scope: group/engineering)
  criterion: integration tests green
  missing evidence: test_run
  suggested command: cargo test --workspace
  last attempt: 2026-08-07 14:22 — failed (3 tests)
```

No opaque "gate failed."

### Invariant 19: Task state != Execution state

These are separate concepts that must never bleed into each other.

**Board state** (semantic, user-visible):

```
todo -> claimed -> in_progress -> review -> done -> verified
                                         -> quarantined
                                         -> discarded
```

**Execution state** (runtime, system-internal):

```
unassigned -> queued -> leased -> running -> waiting
                                          -> rate_limited
                                          -> retrying
                                          -> crashed
                                          -> completed
```

A rate limit changes execution state, never board state. A backend crash changes
execution state, never board state. Context compaction, session replacement, and
provider failover are all execution-state transitions invisible to the board.

The board shows what the work IS. Execution state shows what the worker is DOING.
The orchestrator bridges them: when execution state reaches `completed`, the board
transition to `done` fires (with evidence). When execution state reaches `crashed`,
the orchestrator retries (new session) without touching the board.

### Invariant 20: Provider capacity and usage are normalized, best-effort runtime primitives

Rate limiting is not just detection/recovery. The orchestrator knows provider
capacity BEFORE assignment. Provider usage is normalized across fundamentally
different billing/quota models without inventing numbers that don't exist.

#### Normalized provider usage

"Tokens remaining" means different things per provider:

```
API account:       8.2M tokens used / budget
Subscription:      usage window 73% consumed, resets in 2h 14m
Rate limit:        120k TPM remaining
Daily allowance:   830 requests remaining today
Local Ollama:      effectively unlimited
```

These are not one `tokens_remaining: Option<u64>`.

```rust
struct ProviderUsage {
    provider: ProviderId,
    account: Option<AccountId>,
    windows: Vec<UsageWindow>,
    cost: Option<CostUsage>,
    observed_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    source: UsageSource,
    confidence: UsageConfidence,
}

struct UsageWindow {
    kind: UsageWindowKind,
    tokens_used: Option<u64>,
    tokens_limit: Option<u64>,
    requests_used: Option<u64>,
    requests_limit: Option<u64>,
    utilization: Option<f32>,      // 0.0-1.0, computed when both used+limit known
    resets_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}

enum UsageWindowKind {
    PerMinute,
    PerHour,
    Rolling,
    Daily,
    Weekly,
    Monthly,
    BillingPeriod,
    SubscriptionAllowance,
}

struct CostUsage {
    currency: String,              // USD
    spent: f64,
    budget: Option<f64>,
}

enum UsageSource {
    ProviderApi,                   // provider reports directly
    HeaderParsing,                 // X-RateLimit-* headers
    TerminalDetection,             // rate-limit regex match
    SelfAccounting,                // amux's own token counting
}

enum UsageConfidence {
    Authoritative,                 // provider API
    Observed,                      // derived from signals
    Estimated,                     // amux's approximation
    Unknown,                       // no data available
}
```

`Option` everywhere. If Claude exposes remaining plan allowance, amux shows it.
If it only exposes "rate limited until X", amux records that. If no API exists
(Ollama), amux does not invent a number.

#### Three layers of usage

```
PROVIDER ACCOUNT              WORKER / TASK
Claude plan                   backend-worker
12% allowance remaining       AR-421 consumed 73,221 tokens
resets 8:00 PM
        |
        v
      MODEL
      Sonnet
      input/output usage + pricing
```

This lets the orchestrator answer:
```
Claude has 8% remaining.
AR-421 is estimated at 120k tokens.
Codex has 63% remaining.
-> route AR-421 to Codex.
```

#### Provider capability interface

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait ProviderAdapter: Send + Sync {
    async fn start_session(&self, spec: ProviderSessionSpec) -> Result<ProcessRef>;
    async fn usage(&self) -> Result<ProviderUsage>;
    async fn set_budget(&self, budget: BudgetLimit) -> Result<()>;
    async fn raise_budget(&self, new_limit: BudgetLimit) -> Result<()>;
    fn models(&self) -> &[ModelDescriptor];
    fn capabilities(&self) -> ProviderCapabilities;
}

struct ProviderCapabilities {
    usage_reporting: UsageReporting,
    session_budgets: bool,             // provider supports native budget enforcement
    hot_model_switch: bool,
    context_window_reporting: bool,
    rate_limit_reset_reporting: bool,
    monetary_cost_reporting: bool,
}

enum UsageReporting {
    Full,                          // API returns usage windows
    Partial,                       // headers or rate-limit only
    None,                          // no usage data (Ollama)
}

struct ProviderSessionSpec {
    worker_id: WorkerId,
    model: Option<ModelId>,
    budget: Option<BudgetLimit>,   // passed to provider if session_budgets=true
    environment: ScopedEnv,
    cwd: PathBuf,
}
```

Prevents amux from expecting the same observability from Ollama, Claude Code
OAuth, an Anthropic API key, Gemini, and Codex.

When `session_budgets` is true (Managed Agents), `start_session` passes the
budget to the provider. The provider emits `budget_reached` which the adapter
translates to `WorkerEvent::BudgetPaused`. When `session_budgets` is false,
amux enforces locally via `SelfAccounting` — the adapter's `set_budget` /
`raise_budget` are no-ops and amux pauses the worker's command queue directly.

#### Fleet-level quota state

```rust
struct ProviderQuota {
    provider: ProviderId,
    concurrency_limit: usize,
    active_workers: usize,
    usage: ProviderUsage,          // normalized usage from above
    rolling_error_rate: f32,
    state: ProviderState,
}

enum ProviderState {
    Available,
    Degraded { reason: String },
    QuotaExhausted { window: UsageWindowKind, reset_at: DateTime<Utc> },
    ConcurrencyLimited,
    Unavailable { since: DateTime<Utc> },
    AuthExpired,
}
```

Workers can have fallback chains:

```
preferred: Claude
fallback_1: Codex
fallback_2: Ollama (local, always available)
```

The orchestrator routes work to available providers instead of workers thrashing
against known limits. Distinct failure types get distinct recovery:

| Failure | Recovery |
|---|---|
| `QuotaExhausted` | Wait for reset_at, assign to fallback |
| `ConcurrencyLimited` | Queue, assign when slot opens |
| `Unavailable` | Circuit breaker, exponential backoff + jitter |
| `AuthExpired` | Alert user, block provider until re-auth |
| `NetworkFailure` | Retry with backoff, degrade to local (Ollama) |

#### Fleet-wide rate-limit and subscription coordination

When 20 workers share one Claude subscription and the subscription limit hits,
all 20 must pause — not each independently discover the limit, thrash against it,
and wait for a human to press continue. This is fleet-level coordination using
existing primitives, not a new subsystem.

**The problem the Python server already solves:** rate-limit detection + auto-resume
with a per-session daily budget. The Rust version elevates this from a regex-matching
watchdog to a structural property of the provider layer.

```rust
struct ProviderFleetState {
    provider: ProviderId,
    state: ProviderState,
    affected_workers: Vec<WorkerId>,
    parked_commands: Vec<(WorkerId, CommandId)>,
    resume_strategy: ResumeStrategy,
}

enum ResumeStrategy {
    WaitForReset {
        reset_at: DateTime<Utc>,
        auto_resume: bool,         // default: true -- no human intervention
    },
    Redistribute {
        fallback: ProviderId,
        workers_moved: Vec<WorkerId>,
    },
    Stagger {
        interval: Duration,        // resume workers N seconds apart
        order: Vec<WorkerId>,      // avoid thundering herd
    },
}
```

**Lifecycle (no user intervention required):**

```
1. Worker A hits rate limit
   -> WorkerEvent::RateLimited { reset_at }
   -> ProviderState transitions to QuotaExhausted { reset_at }

2. Orchestrator sees provider is exhausted
   -> STOPS assigning new work to ANY worker on this provider
   -> Workers already running complete their current turn, then park
   -> Commands queue in each worker's command queue (not lost)

3. While waiting:
   -> Workers with fallback chains get redistributed to fallback providers
   -> Workers without fallbacks enter execution state `rate_limited`
   -> Dashboard shows provider card: "Exhausted, resets in 2h 14m, 14 workers parked"

4. Reset time arrives (or provider reports capacity recovered)
   -> ProviderState transitions back to Available
   -> Parked workers resume STAGGERED (not all at once — thundering herd)
   -> Queued commands drain in priority order
   -> No user interaction at any step
```

**Subscription exhaustion** (monthly plan runs out) is the same flow with a longer
`reset_at` (next billing cycle). The orchestrator treats it identically — redistribute
to fallback providers, park workers without fallbacks, auto-resume when the window
resets. If no fallback is configured and the subscription is truly exhausted, the
dashboard surfaces this clearly and the workers stay parked until the subscription
renews — but the user never has to press "continue" on each worker individually.

**Stagger protocol** prevents thundering herd on resume:

```rust
fn resume_parked_workers(provider: &ProviderFleetState) -> Vec<ScheduledResume> {
    let interval = Duration::from_secs(5);  // configurable
    provider.affected_workers.iter().enumerate().map(|(i, w)| {
        ScheduledResume {
            worker: *w,
            resume_at: provider.reset_at + interval * i as u32,
        }
    }).collect()
}
```

This replaces the Python server's regex-based rate-limit watchdog + daily budget
counter with structural provider state that the orchestrator reasons about directly.
The auto-resume is not a scraper pressing keys — it is the orchestrator unparking
workers when `ProviderState` transitions back to `Available`.

#### Dashboard provider card

```
Claude
Sonnet 4.5

Plan allowance     [|||||||---]  72%
Resets             2h 14m
Current context    84k / 200k
Today              4.1M tokens
This task         83k tokens
Fleet active       14 workers
Rate state         Available
```

Unsupported values show `--`, never a guessed number. Aggregate metrics:
tokens/verified-task, tokens/worker, tokens/provider, tokens/model, provider
allowance remaining, context remaining per active worker.

### Invariant 21: Backend and provider conformance suites

Every backend implementation passes the exact same test suite without changing tests.
Every provider adapter passes the exact same test suite without changing tests.

```rust
// Backend conformance: process lifecycle ONLY (spawn, stop, inspect).
// Runs against MockBackend, HerdrBackend, TmuxBackend, NativePtyBackend:
mod backend_conformance {
    // Process lifecycle
    async fn test_spawn(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);
    async fn test_terminate(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);
    async fn test_status_running(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);
    async fn test_status_after_terminate(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);
    async fn test_process_crash(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);
    async fn test_backend_daemon_disappears(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);
    async fn test_attach_info(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);

    // Reconciliation
    async fn test_restart_reconciliation(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);
    async fn test_stale_session_reconciliation(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);

    // Scale
    async fn test_concurrent_spawns(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);
    async fn test_40_worker_spawn(backend: &dyn SessionBackend);
}

// Protocol conformance: agent communication (prompts, messages, cancel, state).
// Runs against MockProtocol, OpenCodeProtocol:
mod protocol_conformance {
    async fn test_send_prompt(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_deliver_message(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_cancel(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_pause_resume(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_state_query(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_event_stream(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_command_idempotency(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_no_duplicate_delivery_after_restart(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_multiline_prompt(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_unicode_prompt(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
    async fn test_large_prompt(proto: &dyn AgentProtocol);
}
```

**The invariant: no test above the backend/provider layer knows which
backend/provider is running. No test above the protocol layer knows which
agent protocol implementation is in use.**

### Invariant 33: Backend independence

Switching a worker between herdr, tmux, and a future native PTY must not alter its
worker identity, task lifecycle, messages, context, turns, gates, verification
behavior, scheduling behavior, or observable API semantics.

```rust
// All of WorkerConfig is mutable configuration, not identity (Invariant 43).
struct WorkerConfig {
    cwd: PathBuf,
    provider: ProviderId,
    model: Option<ModelId>,
    backend: BackendId,    // default: "herdr" -- open string (Invariant 8)
    environment: ScopedEnv,
    permissions: Permissions,
    isolation: IsolationPolicy,  // default: Shared
    model_budgets: Vec<WorkerModelBudget>,  // per-model spend limits (Invariant 16)
    // Changing any field is valid. Some changes require session restart.
    // Everything above the SessionBackend/AgentProtocol traits is unchanged.
}

// BackendId is a string, not a closed enum (see Invariant 8).
// Built-in backends: "herdr" (default), "tmux" (fallback), "native-pty" (future).
// New backends register via the BackendRegistry trait without recompiling amux-core.

enum IsolationPolicy {
    Shared,                         // default -- workers share a single checkout
    Worktree { base: PathBuf },     // git worktree per worker
    Container { image: String },    // container per worker (future)
}
```

Scoped like everything else (Org/Global/Group/Worker via Invariant 2).

**Shared isolation caveat (Invariant 28 interaction):** under `IsolationPolicy::Shared`,
`cargo test` exit codes are evidence about the shared tree, not about any individual
worker's change. Acceptance criteria that need per-worker attribution of test results
(e.g., "this worker's change did not break the build") must declare
`IsolationPolicy::Worktree`. Under `Shared`, a dirty tree or merge conflict is
`WaitingFor::TreeConflict { holder, path }` -- a structured wait reason, not
`StallReason::ProcessDown`.

**Invariant 49 interaction:** under `Shared`, `AttemptRecord.failure_reason` may
reflect another worker's breakage. The failure-feeds-forward context becomes
actively misleading if the tree state is not attributed. When `isolation == Shared`,
the attempt record must include the tree's `git status` at failure time so the next
attempt can distinguish "my code broke" from "the tree was dirty when I started."

The layering:

```
Orchestrator
    |
    +------ AgentProtocol (OpenCode) ------+
    |       prompts, messages, cancel,     |
    |       events, state queries          |
    |                                      |
    +------ SessionBackend ------+         |
            process lifecycle    |         |
            (spawn, stop,        |         |
             inspect only)       |         |
            |                    |         |
            +-- HerdrBackend    [default]  |

            +-- NativePtyBackend [future]  |
                                           v
                                    WorkerEvent stream
```

OpenCode and SessionBackend are independent axes with non-overlapping
responsibilities. OpenCode carries all agent communication: prompts, messages,
cancellation, lifecycle queries, and events. SessionBackend carries only
process lifecycle: spawn, terminate, inspect, reconcile. The orchestrator
never sends a prompt through the backend.

When OpenCode is unavailable (e.g., a provider that does not support it yet),
the terminal adapter falls back to scraping for state and to `send-keys`-style
input -- but this is the degraded path, not the design center.

Rate limits, turns, compaction, messages, task state, gates, verification,
scheduling, and worker state are completely backend-independent. A worker can
restart on a different backend while preserving all durable amux state. Backend
choice does not require DB/schema changes and does not change worker identity or
task ownership.

### Invariant 34: Explicit queue semantics

Every queue in the system has a defined delivery contract. The contract specifies
persistence, ordering, dedup, delivery confirmation, retry policy, and dead-letter
behavior. This is especially important with herdr as the default backend: the queue
between the orchestrator and the backend is the critical delivery path, and its
semantics must be testable independently of any backend implementation.

#### The five queues

```rust
struct CommandQueue {
    worker_id: WorkerId,
    commands: VecDeque<QueuedCommand>,
    capacity: usize,               // configurable, default 16
    overflow: OverflowPolicy,      // Reject429
}

struct QueuedCommand {
    id: CommandId,
    command: WorkerCommand,
    idempotency_key: Uuid,
    enqueued_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    expires_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    precondition: Option<CommandPrecondition>,
    deliver_at: DeliveryTiming,    // Immediate | AtTurnBoundary | After(Duration)
    attempts: u32,
    max_attempts: u32,             // default 3
    state: CommandState,
}

enum CommandState {
    Queued,
    Dispatched { at: DateTime<Utc>, backend_ack: bool },
    Delivered { at: DateTime<Utc> },
    Confirmed { at: DateTime<Utc>, outcome: CommandOutcome },
    Failed { at: DateTime<Utc>, reason: String },
    DeadLettered { at: DateTime<Utc>, reason: String },
}
```

| Queue | Persistence | Ordering | Overflow | Retry | Dead letter |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Command queue** (per worker) | DB-backed, survives restart | FIFO within priority | Reject 429 at capacity | 3 attempts, backoff | Dead-letter after max attempts, alert |
| **Event channel** (per worker) | In-memory, lossy | Causal (per worker) | Drop oldest, gap marker | No retry (events are facts) | N/A |
| **SSE channel** (per subscriber) | In-memory, lossy | Global rev ordered (Invariant 35) | Drop oldest + reconnect hint | Client detects rev gap, delta syncs | N/A |
| **DB write queue** | In-memory, bounded | Serialized (single writer) | Backpressure -> 503 | Retry on SQLITE_BUSY (3x) | Fail request |
| **Message queue** (Invariant 29) | DB-backed, durable | FIFO per thread | No bound (durable) | Deliver at next turn boundary | Never (messages are durable) |

#### Command delivery contract

The command queue is DB-backed because commands must survive server restarts (the
Python system lost pending steering messages on every restart). The delivery
protocol:

```
1. API/orchestrator enqueues command (persisted to DB, idempotency key recorded)
2. Orchestrator tick: pick next command for each idle/waiting worker
3. Dispatch through AgentProtocol (OpenCode) -- direct to agent, not through backend
4. OpenCode acknowledges receipt (structured response)
5. WorkerEvent confirms execution (worker acted on it)
6. Command marked Confirmed with outcome

If step 3 fails: check process liveness via SessionBackend.status()
If step 4 times out: retry with backoff (OpenCode process may be busy)
If step 5 never arrives: after timeout, mark DeadLettered + StallViolation
```

Duplicate commands with the same idempotency key return the existing result without
re-dispatching. This is critical during restarts: the reconciliation loop
(Invariant 9) reprocesses pending commands, and idempotency prevents double delivery.

#### Command preconditions (freshness at delivery)

A queued command may have been valid at creation time but false at delivery time.
From the commit history: notifications keyed off current state instead of the
assignment event; nudges told workers to act on work whose state had since changed;
steering re-checked whether a board card still existed before delivery.

The fix: automated commands that depend on state carry preconditions and are
revalidated at delivery time.

```rust
enum CommandPrecondition {
    EntityVersion { entity_type: EntityType, entity_id: EntityId, version: u64 },
    EntityStatus { entity_type: EntityType, entity_id: EntityId, status: Status },
    And(Vec<CommandPrecondition>),
}
```

At delivery, the orchestrator evaluates the precondition against current state.
If it fails:

```rust
enum PreconditionResult {
    Satisfied,
    Failed { expected: String, actual: String },
    EntityGone,
}

// Failed precondition -> command expires, never delivered
CommandState::Expired { reason: PreconditionResult }
```

Human-authored messages (user sends text to a worker) carry no precondition and
always deliver. State assertions and automation commands (nudges, advance,
reassignment) carry preconditions. This is the root fix for an entire family of
stale-nudge bugs.

Example:
```
"Tell worker to review AR-42"
precondition: AR-42.version == 17 AND AR-42.status == review

At delivery, AR-42 is now verified:
  -> CommandState::Expired { PreconditionResult::Failed }
  -> not delivered, DurableEvent emitted
```

#### Event ordering guarantees

WorkerEvents are causally ordered per worker but NOT globally ordered across workers.
This matches reality: worker A's TurnCompleted and worker B's TurnStarted have no
causal relationship.

```rust
struct WorkerEvent {
    // ...
    sequence: u64,       // monotonic per worker, for gap detection
    worker_id: WorkerId, // causal ordering is per-worker
}
```

The event channel uses sequence numbers so consumers detect gaps. A gap means
events were dropped under backpressure; the consumer must re-read current state
from the DB rather than inferring it from the event stream.

#### Delivery timing

Not all commands should fire immediately:

```rust
enum DeliveryTiming {
    Immediate,
    AtTurnBoundary,     // steering messages, memory refresh
    After(Duration),    // delayed retry, scheduled commands
    WhenIdle,           // queue until worker finishes current turn
}
```

`AtTurnBoundary` is where messages (Invariant 29) and context refresh are delivered.
`WhenIdle` prevents interrupting a worker mid-turn with a lower-priority command.
`Immediate` is for Cancel, Pause, and Resume -- they override turn boundaries.

#### Dead-letter and observability

Commands that exhaust retries become dead letters. A dead letter is a system failure
(something the orchestrator wanted to happen did not happen) and produces:

1. A `DurableEvent::CommandDeadLettered` with the full command and failure reason
2. A `StallViolation` if the command was task-related (Invariant 10)
3. A dashboard alert on the worker card

Dead letters are queryable: `GET /api/workers/:id/dead-letters`. The dashboard shows
a count badge on the worker card when dead letters exist. This replaces the Python
system's silent failure mode where steering messages vanished on restart with no trace.

#### Queue depth as a health signal

```rust
struct QueueHealth {
    worker_id: WorkerId,
    depth: usize,
    oldest_command_age: Duration,
    dead_letter_count: u32,
    delivery_rate: f32,     // commands confirmed / commands enqueued, trailing 1h
}
```

A delivery rate below 90% or an oldest command older than 60s triggers a dashboard
warning. The orchestrator uses queue depth as an input to work assignment: a worker
with a deep queue is not a good candidate for new work.

### Invariant 35: Server-authoritative revisioned state

**The backend database is authoritative. The UI may optimistically predict future
state, but every displayed entity must eventually converge to an explicitly
revisioned backend state. Missing, duplicate, reordered, or stale realtime events
must never produce persistent UI divergence.**

SSE is notification, not the source of truth. The UI never infers "latest" from
whichever SSE message it happened to receive last.

#### Global revision

Every mutating DB transaction increments a monotonic global revision. The revision
is the single source of ordering for all state changes across all entity types.

```rust
struct StateRevision {
    rev: u64,                  // monotonically increasing, never reset
    entity_type: EntityType,   // Worker, Task, Message, Group, Gate, ...
    entity_id: EntityId,
    mutation: Mutation,        // what changed
    at: DateTime<Utc>,
}

// DB: single row table, updated in the same transaction as the mutation
// CREATE TABLE global_rev (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY CHECK(id = 1), rev INTEGER NOT NULL);
// Every mutating transaction: UPDATE global_rev SET rev = rev + 1 RETURNING rev;
```

#### Entity versions

Each entity carries its own version in addition to the global revision. Global
`rev` answers "what is the latest system state?" Entity `version` answers "is
this exact entity stale?"

```rust
struct Task {
    id: TaskId,
    version: u64,              // incremented on every mutation to THIS task
    // ...
}

struct Worker {
    id: WorkerId,
    version: u64,
    // ...
}
```

Concurrency checks use entity version. Global revision drives sync ordering.

#### Event publishing

Every DB mutation publishes a revisioned event:

```
DB mutation
   ↓
commit transaction (atomically increments global rev)
   ↓
publish event { rev, entity_type, entity_id, mutation }
   ↓
UI applies only if rev > local rev
```

```rust
struct StateEvent {
    rev: u64,
    entity_type: EntityType,
    entity_id: EntityId,
    mutation: Mutation,
}
```

SSE carries `StateEvent`s. Each SSE stream has its own **stream sequence number**
(`stream_seq`), separate from the global tenant revision (`rev`). The stream
sequence is contiguous per-subscriber; the global revision is not, because
org/group/permission filtering means a client does not see every mutation.
Using `rev` for contiguity detection would create a permanent false-gap loop
under filtered streams.

```typescript
function onStateEvent(event: StateEvent) {
    if (event.stream_seq <= state.lastStreamSeq) return;  // stale, ignore

    if (event.stream_seq !== state.lastStreamSeq + 1) {
        reconcileFrom(state.lastRev);                     // gap detected, delta sync
        return;
    }

    applyMutation(event);
    state.lastStreamSeq = event.stream_seq;
    state.lastRev = event.rev;  // track global rev for delta sync requests
}
```

The server assigns `stream_seq` per subscriber connection. On reconnect, the
client sends `since_rev` (the last global revision it applied) and receives a
fresh stream with `stream_seq` starting at 1. The delta sync endpoint uses
global `rev` (which is the tenant-wide ordering); the SSE stream uses
`stream_seq` (which is the per-subscriber ordering). These are independent
sequences serving different purposes.

#### Delta sync endpoint

On initial load, reconnect, tab wake, browser `online`, or detected revision gap:

```
GET /api/sync?since_rev=104
```

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct SyncResponse {
    rev: u64,                              // current global revision
    changes: Vec<StateEvent>,             // all mutations since since_rev
    full_sync_required: bool,             // true if since_rev is too old (pruned)
}
```

The server retains a bounded changelog (configurable, default 10,000 revisions).
If `since_rev` is older than the oldest retained revision, `full_sync_required`
is true and the client does a full state load instead of a delta.

This handles: dropped SSE connections, laptop sleep, flaky Wi-Fi, browser
throttling, server restart, SSE backpressure drops.

#### Optimistic writes with conflict detection

Mutating API calls include the base revision for conflict detection:

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
struct MutationRequest<T> {
    #[serde(flatten)]
    payload: T,
    base_rev: u64,                        // client's last known entity version
    idempotency_key: Option<Uuid>,
}
```

The backend either commits and returns the new revision:

```json
{ "rev": 108, "version": 18, "entity": { ... } }
```

Or rejects as stale:

```
409 Conflict
{ "server_rev": 107, "server_version": 17, "current": { ... } }
```

The client reconciles on conflict. Offline/slow clients cannot silently overwrite
newer state.

#### Normalized client-side state store

One canonical local entity cache. Every screen reads from the same entities:

```typescript
interface EntityStore {
    workers: Map<WorkerId, Worker>;
    tasks: Map<TaskId, Task>;
    groups: Map<GroupId, Group>;
    messages: Map<MessageId, Message>;
    gates: Map<GateId, Gate>;
    sessions: Map<SessionId, Session>;
    lastRev: number;
}
```

The board does not maintain one copy of a task while the task-detail modal has
another. Views are projections over the store, not independent state. A mutation
from any source (SSE event, API response, optimistic write) updates the store
once; every view re-renders from the same data.

#### Connection state indicator

The UI shows connection state, subtle but always visible:

```
LIVE · rev 18291
SYNCING…
OFFLINE · last synced 2m ago
STALE · reconnecting
```

Transitions:

| From | To | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| LIVE | STALE | SSE silence > 18s (existing ping timeout) |
| LIVE | OFFLINE | browser `offline` event |
| STALE | SYNCING | reconnect attempt starts |
| OFFLINE | SYNCING | browser `online` event |
| SYNCING | LIVE | delta sync completes, SSE reconnected |
| SYNCING | STALE | delta sync fails, retrying |

#### Reconciliation triggers

Delta sync fires on all of these (not just SSE reconnect):

1. Initial page load
2. SSE reconnect after drop
3. Tab wake (`visibilitychange` visible)
4. Browser `online` event
5. `pageshow` / `focus` events
6. Revision gap detected in SSE stream
7. Periodic heartbeat (every 60s while LIVE, as a safety net)
8. After any 409 Conflict response

#### E2E test plan

The ugly cases, tested explicitly:

- Drop every 5th SSE event -> UI converges to correct state
- Deliver events out of order -> UI stays correct (revision ordering)
- Duplicate events -> no duplicate effects (idempotent apply)
- Kill/restart server -> UI reconnects and catches up via delta sync
- Sleep browser for 10 minutes -> wakes and delta-syncs to current
- Two tabs mutate same task -> both converge to same state
- Offline mutation conflicts with newer backend state -> explicit 409, toast
- 1,000 rapid board mutations -> UI finishes at exactly backend rev/state
- SSE backpressure drops 50 events -> gap detection triggers reconcile
- Server changelog pruned (since_rev too old) -> full sync, not partial
- Entity version conflict (two clients edit same task) -> loser gets 409
- Optimistic write applied then server rejects -> rollback visible to user

### Invariant 36: Single source of truth

**Every durable fact has exactly one canonical owner. Everything else is a projection,
cache, index, or derived representation.**

This is the most frequently violated principle in the commit history. The 30-day
audit found it in multiple independent subsystems:

- `acceb79f`: composer draft lived in 3 stores; clearing one let two others resurrect it
- `59a90e9`: browser profile you logged into vs. profile the agent opened were different stores
- `89e7981`: two things wrote spend; the approximate poller overwrote exact proxy metering
- `b63e0e3`: every UI surface independently guessed what kind of message something was
- `04b2dfc`: server and client had different ideas of valid statuses

The canonical owners:

```
Task state          -> Board (Invariant 3)
Worker state        -> Worker state machine (Invariant 11)
Message             -> Message store (Invariant 29)
Gate definition     -> Gate store (Invariant 18)
Memory              -> MemoryEntry table (Invariant 42)
Provider state      -> Runtime event stream (Invariant 20)
Browser profile     -> BrowserProfile store
Schedule            -> DurableSchedule table
Scope config        -> Scope resolver (Invariant 2)
Search index        -> Derived from source entities (Invariant 32)
UI state            -> Projection of EntityStore (Invariant 35)
```

The dashboard cache is NOT state. `MEMORY.md` is NOT memory. Herdr output is NOT
worker state. Search index is NOT content. A compacted summary is NOT history.

Implementation: every entity store has a single write path. Caches and projections
are regenerated from the canonical source, never written back. When a cache
disagrees with its source, the source wins unconditionally -- there is no merge.

### Invariant 37: Mutation truthfulness

**A successful mutation response states exactly what was applied. Revision increments
iff authoritative state changed. Unknown mutation fields are errors, never silently
ignored.**

From the commit history: PATCHes that returned 200 but applied nothing; fields
silently dropped from requests; `rev` bumped on no-ops (making "did it change?"
unreliable); `ignored_fields` carried in the response body but never read.

```rust
#[derive(Deserialize)]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]  // unknown fields are errors, not silent drops
struct TaskPatch {
    status: Option<Status>,
    desc: Option<String>,
    // ...
    base_rev: u64,             // required for optimistic concurrency (Invariant 35)
}

struct MutationResult {
    applied: bool,             // false if the mutation was a no-op
    rev: u64,                  // incremented only if applied == true
    version: u64,              // entity version, incremented only if applied == true
    entity: Task,              // current state after (possibly no-op) mutation
}
```

A no-op mutation (setting status to its current value) returns `applied: false`
with the current revision unchanged. The client can distinguish "I changed it"
from "it was already there." Entity version and global revision ONLY increment
on actual state changes.

### Invariant 38: Command freshness

**Automated queued commands that depend on state carry preconditions and are
revalidated at delivery time.** Human-authored messages always deliver.

Defined in Invariant 34 (command preconditions section). Elevated to a standalone
invariant because the commit history shows this as a distinct recurring failure
class: notifications keyed off current state instead of the assignment event,
nudges driving work whose state had changed, steering messages arriving for
tasks that no longer exist.

The invariant: a command whose precondition fails at delivery time is expired,
not delivered. The expiration is recorded as a `DurableEvent` (Invariant 24).
Blindly redelivering a durable stale instruction makes the system more reliable
at doing the wrong thing.

### Invariant 39: Derived-data direction

**Source -> derived, never reverse. Search indexes, compacted context, generated
memory files, caches, and UI state never write themselves back into their source
without an explicit user mutation.**

```
canonical entity (DB)
      |
      +-> search index (FTS5)
      +-> worker context (assembled)
      +-> compacted summary (lossy)
      +-> MEMORY.md (projected)
      +-> dashboard cache (IndexedDB)
      +-> iCal feed (generated)

NONE of these arrows reverse.
```

A compacted summary may supersede old content for prompt assembly (Invariant 31),
but it never overwrites or becomes the source history. Search results point to
source entities; modifying a search result modifies the entity, not the index.
Memory is read from `MemoryEntry` rows; `MEMORY.md` is a generated projection,
not a source file.

The violation pattern from the commit history:
```
canonical state
     |
generated representation
     |
gets read back as canonical
     |
old/generated data overwrites newer source
```

This invariant makes that arrow structurally impossible: derived representations
have no write path back to their source.

### Invariant 40: Collection completeness

**Every truncated or paginated response declares whether it is complete and
provides `total/returned/cursor` semantics.**

From the commit history: "we fetched 50 and didn't find it" became "it doesn't
exist" because nothing distinguished a complete result from a truncated one.

```rust
struct PagedResponse<T> {
    items: Vec<T>,
    total: usize,              // total matching items (not just this page)
    returned: usize,           // items in this response
    cursor: Option<String>,    // None = this is the last page
    is_complete: bool,         // true iff returned == total
}
```

Every list endpoint uses `PagedResponse`. The dashboard shows "showing N of M"
when truncated. Search results that hit a limit display the limit. API consumers
can always distinguish "empty result" from "result truncated before the item you
wanted."

### Invariant 41: Test oracle correctness

**Tests must prove externally observable outcomes, not implementation activity.**

The commit history shows tests that passed while the system was broken:

- `8bc9eb3`: a shell prompt was output, so the cloud provider smoke test passed
  (the provider was completely broken)
- `7870384`: the echoed prompt contained expected words, so verification passed
  (the worker never executed anything)
- `9cd2892`: "dashboard renders" passed against Chrome's Privacy error interstitial
  (TLS cert was invalid)
- `2cdbd8a`: "Security scan passed" even though the grep itself errored and never
  scanned anything (exit code not checked)

These are oracle correctness problems, not missing-test problems.

Three testing layers beyond example-based Playwright:

**1. Property testing** (`proptest`) for system invariants (already in Invariant 22):
```rust
proptest! {
    fn single_source_of_truth(ops in arb_ops()) {
        // after any sequence of operations, every derived representation
        // matches its canonical source
    }
    fn liveness(ops in arb_ops()) {
        // every non-terminal task has a runnable action, assigned actor,
        // or structured wait reason
    }
    fn revision_monotonicity(ops in arb_ops()) {
        // global rev never decreases; entity version never decreases
    }
    fn convergence(events in arb_sse_events()) {
        // after applying any permutation of events with gap detection,
        // client state matches server state
    }
}
```

**2. Deterministic orchestrator simulation** (Invariant 22) with fake
time/providers/backends.

**3. Historical incident regression corpus**: encode the last month's incidents
as concrete test cases. Every Rust build proves the architecture cannot reproduce
them.

```rust
mod incident_regression {
    fn incident_2026_07_30_451_fold_card();       // card with 451 tasks
    fn incident_2026_07_30_duplicate_draft();     // draft in 3 stores
    fn incident_2026_07_30_board_read_after_write(); // stale cache
    fn incident_2026_07_31_glyph_mismatch();      // Unicode rate-limit
    fn incident_2026_08_xx_stale_steering();       // nudge to changed card
    fn incident_2026_08_xx_shell_prompt_passes();  // wrong oracle
    fn incident_2026_08_xx_echo_satisfies_verify(); // self-reported evidence
    fn incident_2026_08_xx_tls_error_renders();    // interstitial passes
    fn incident_2026_08_xx_two_spend_writers();    // poller overwrites meter
    fn incident_2026_08_xx_profile_store_split();  // login vs agent profiles
    fn incident_2026_08_xx_archived_doing();       // nonsensical state combo
}
```

Each test reconstructs the incident's preconditions and asserts the architecture
rejects them structurally, not by a test that happens to check for them.

### Invariant 22: Deterministic orchestrator simulation

Instead of requiring real workers for all orchestration tests, the orchestrator runs
against a fake clock + fake provider + fake backend:

```
t=0   task created
t=1   worker claims (lease 30s)
t=3   provider rate-limits
t=20  rate-limit resets
t=21  worker resumes
t=25  worker crashes (OOM)
t=26  lease reclaimed
t=27  worker-2 takes task
t=40  worker-2 completes
t=41  verification passes
t=42  task verified
```

Assert the entire event stream. Fuzz thousands of workflows in seconds. Catch race
conditions that Playwright will never reliably hit.

Use `proptest` for property/invariant testing:

```rust
// For arbitrary generated event sequences, assert:
proptest! {
    fn no_double_lease(events in arb_events()) {
        // a task cannot have two live leases simultaneously
    }
    fn verified_implies_done(events in arb_events()) {
        // verified implies done occurred previously
    }
    fn blocked_dep_never_runnable(events in arb_events()) {
        // a blocked dependency can never be marked runnable
    }
    fn idempotent_replay(events in arb_events()) {
        // replaying the same events produces identical final state
    }
    fn no_unaudited_bypass(events in arb_events()) {
        // every force bypass has an audit entry with actor
    }
}
```

### Invariant 23: Server-side integration degradation

amux keeps orchestrating when external services disappear. Every integration has a
capability state:

```rust
enum IntegrationState {
    Available,
    Degraded { reason: String },
    Offline { since: DateTime<Utc> },
    AuthExpired,
    RateLimited { reset_at: DateTime<Utc> },
}

// The orchestrator checks before assignment:
// Issues requiring unavailable capabilities become capability-blocked,
// not repeatedly retried.
```

Internet disappears: local orchestrator keeps running. Claude disappears: Ollama
workers keep going. GitHub disappears: git operations queue. Gmail disappears: email
operations queue. The system degrades, names what's degraded, and recovers
automatically when connectivity returns.

### Invariant 24: Immutable event history

Every meaningful state mutation emits an append-only event:

```rust
struct DurableEvent {
    id: EventId,
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    actor: Actor,
    kind: EventKind,
    entity_id: String,  // task, worker, schedule, etc.
    payload: EventPayload,
    causality: Option<EventId>,  // the event that caused this one
}

enum EventKind {
    TaskCreated,
    TaskClaimed,
    TaskStarted,
    GateBlocked,
    GateSatisfied,
    WorkerMentioned,
    CommandQueued,
    CommandDelivered,
    CommandSent { text: String, delivery: DeliveryTiming },
    TurnStarted,

}
```

#### Replay-capable event log

The event log is verbose enough to replay exactly what happened. This is not
event sourcing (current state is still the DB row), but the log must answer:
"given the same starting state, what did each actor do, in what order, with
what inputs, producing what outputs?"

```rust
enum EventPayload {
    Inline(Value),             // small payloads stored directly
    BlobRef {                  // large payloads (model I/O, file diffs)
        hash: Hash,
        size: u64,
        store: BlobStore,      // local SQLite blob, S3, or filesystem
    },
}

struct ReplaySegment {
    worker_id: WorkerId,
    task_id: Option<TaskId>,
    events: Vec<DurableEvent>,   // causally ordered
    start_state: StateSnapshot,  // worker + task state at segment start
    end_state: StateSnapshot,    // expected state after replay
}
```

**What gets captured per turn (the replay contract):**

```
1. CommandSent        — exact text delivered to the worker
2. TurnStarted        — with turn_id and context token count
3. ModelRequest*      — every model call: model, input tokens, prompt hash
4. ModelResponse*     — every response: output tokens, duration, content hash
5. ToolUsed*          — every tool call: name, args hash, result hash
6. FileWritten*       — every file mutation: path, content hash, diff
7. TurnCompleted      — outcome, tokens consumed, duration
8. State transitions  — any board/task/gate changes caused by this turn
```

Items marked `*` repeat per occurrence within a turn. Content hashes let you
verify replay fidelity without storing full model I/O inline (the blobs are
in `BlobStore`, retrievable by hash).

**Replay modes:**

- **Audit replay**: read-only, verify that events reproduce the recorded
  state transitions. No model calls. Answers "did the system behave correctly?"
- **Debug replay**: step through a worker's turn history interactively.
  Show what the orchestrator saw, what it decided, what the worker received.
- **Fork replay**: replay up to event N, then diverge with a different
  decision. Answers "what would have happened if we'd routed to worker B?"

**Causality chain:** `DurableEvent.causality` links effect to cause. A
`TaskStarted` points to the `OrchestratorDecision` that assigned it. A
`GateSatisfied` points to the `ToolUsed` that produced the evidence. Walking
the chain from any event reconstructs the full decision tree.

**Blob lifecycle:** blobs older than the retention window (default: 30 days)
are eligible for pruning. Event rows survive pruning — they retain hashes
for verification but `BlobRef` resolution returns `BlobPruned`. Recent events
(configurable) always retain blobs for active replay.

### Invariant 25: Priority and scheduling hints

Dependency graphs tell you what CAN run. Priority tells you what SHOULD run first.

```rust
struct SchedulingHints {
    priority: Priority,
    deadline: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    estimated_cost: Option<TokenCost>,
    preferred_worker: Option<WorkerId>,
    affinity: Vec<Affinity>,
}
```

The orchestrator scores candidates:

```
dependency critical path weight
+ explicit priority
+ age/starvation (prevent indefinite queue)
+ worker affinity (cached context reuse)
+ provider availability (don't assign to rate-limited)
+ estimated token cost (cheap work first when budget-constrained)
```

Without this, 380 TODO items becomes FIFO, which is the wrong order most of the time.

### Invariant 26: Backpressure on every channel

Rust removes Python's accidental serialization (GIL). Every async channel needs
explicit bounds and overflow semantics.

```rust
// Every mpsc channel has a bound:
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel::<DbWrite>(1024);        // DB write queue
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel::<WorkerEvent>(256);      // event channel
let (tx, rx) = mpsc::channel::<SseEvent>(64);           // per-subscriber SSE

// Overflow semantics are explicit per channel:
// DB writes: block sender (backpressure to API handler -> 503)
// WorkerEvents: drop oldest (stale events are worse than gaps)
// SSE: drop oldest + send "reconnect" hint
// Command queue per worker: bounded at 16, reject with 429
```

Never use an unbounded `mpsc`. Every queue's bound is a configuration value, not a
magic constant.

### Invariant 27: Immutable context snapshots

Every assignment records exactly what the worker received.

```rust
struct ContextSnapshot {
    id: ContextSnapshotId,
    task_id: TaskId,
    worker_id: WorkerId,
    hash: Hash,
    fragments: Vec<FragmentRef>,
    total_tokens: u32,
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

Behavior becomes reproducible: "worker X failed AR-123 using context snapshot C-991."
Context caching becomes trivial: if the hash matches, reuse. Token optimization
becomes measurable: compare snapshot sizes across attempts.

### Invariant 28: Cheapest verifier first + evidence independence

Verification uses the cheapest/most deterministic verifier that can prove each
criterion:

| Criterion | Verifier | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| Tests green | `cargo test` exit code | Free |
| HTTP 200 | curl | Free |
| DOM contains element | Playwright assertion | Cheap |
| Artifact exists | `stat` | Free |
| Git commit merged | `git log --oneline` | Free |
| Screenshot visually correct | Model judgment or human | Expensive |
| Requirement semantically satisfied | Model judgment | Expensive |

Never call a model when a deterministic check suffices. This is Invariant 15 rule 1
applied to verification specifically.

**Evidence independence: verification cannot be satisfied solely by output produced
by the actor whose claim is being verified, when independent evidence is available.**

This principle comes directly from the commit history:

- `8bc9eb3`: a shell prompt was output, so the test said the provider was healthy
- `7870384`: the echoed prompt contained the expected words, so verification passed
- `9cd2892`: Chrome's "Privacy error" page had a title, so "dashboard renders" passed

The fix is structural: verifiers check externally observable outcomes, not
implementation activity.

```
BAD:  process emitted output
GOOD: provider returned structured result matching expected schema

BAD:  page title exists
GOOD: known amux DOM element is visible + hydrated + contains expected data

BAD:  worker said "tests passed"
GOOD: harness independently executed tests and observed exit code

BAD:  message was injected into terminal
GOOD: recipient acknowledged MessageId via WorkerEvent
```

```rust
// VerifierKind is the SINGLE evaluation primitive. GateEvaluator is merged into it
// (Invariant 28 gates and Invariant 28/45 verification use the same spec).
// Definable in config, no recompile needed.
enum VerifierKind {
    Command { cmd: String, expected_exit: i32 },
    HttpCheck { url: Url, expected_status: u16 },
    FileExists { path: PathBuf },
    PlaywrightAssertion { script: String },
    ModelJudgment { prompt: String },
    Composite { all: Vec<VerifierKind> },         // all must pass
    AnyOf { any: Vec<VerifierKind> },             // at least one must pass
    Extension { kind: String, config: Value },    // plugin verifiers
}

struct Verification {
    kind: VerifierKind,
    evidence_source: EvidenceSource,
}

enum EvidenceSource {
    Independent,              // harness/external tool ran the check
    SelfReported,             // the actor being verified reported it
    Corroborated,             // self-reported + independently confirmed
}
```

Verifiers run in cost order. If the free checks fail, expensive ones never run.
When independent evidence is available, self-reported evidence alone is
insufficient -- the verifier must corroborate or independently confirm.

### Invariant 29: Message is a durable entity, not command plumbing

Steering messages, `@worker` mentions, task discussion, and offline commands are all
the same thing: a **Message**. Making it an explicit durable entity gives you threads,
unread state, delivery tracking, search, and audit history without building each one
separately.

```rust
struct Message {
    id: MessageId,
    from: ActorRef,
    to: Vec<ActorRef>,       // worker/group/user/orchestrator
    task_id: Option<TaskId>,
    thread_id: ThreadId,
    body: String,
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    delivery: DeliveryState,
}

enum DeliveryState {
    Queued,
    Delivered { at: DateTime<Utc> },
    Read { at: DateTime<Utc> },
    Failed { reason: String },
}
```

`WorkerCommand::Steer` becomes `WorkerCommand::DeliverMessage(MessageId)`. The
orchestrator delivers messages at turn boundaries (Invariant 6). Offline messages
queue in IndexedDB and sync on reconnect (Invariant 14). `@worker-3` in a task
description creates a Message addressed to worker-3 with the task_id set. Threads
let a worker reply to a steering message and the reply appears in the task activity.

### Invariant 30: Structured events for machines, append-only logs for humans

Two separate concepts that share correlation IDs but serve different consumers:

**Structured events** (`DurableEvent`, Invariant 24): machine-readable, typed,
queryable, and **replay-capable**. The orchestrator, dashboard, API, and replay
engine consume these. They drive state transitions, metrics, the `why-blocked`
query, and full session replay. Every event carries enough detail (typed payloads,
content hashes, causality links) to reconstruct exactly what happened.

**Logs/output**: human-readable, append-only, unstructured text. Worker terminal
output, tool call results, error messages, debug traces. Humans read these when
debugging.

A task detail exposes both, correlated by task/worker/turn IDs:

```
Task AR-421 detail:
  Activity          — messages + transitions (human timeline)
  Messages          — thread of steering/discussion
  Worker output     — raw terminal capture per turn
  Tool calls        — structured tool events
  Transitions       — board state machine history
  Replay            — step-through or audit replay of the turn sequence
  Gate evaluations  — gate checks with evidence
  Verification      — criteria + evidence + result
  System events     — orchestrator decisions, lease changes
```

Everything is cross-linked: clicking a gate evaluation shows the tool call that
produced the evidence, the turn it ran in, the worker output surrounding it, and the
message that triggered the work.

### Invariant 31: Compaction is a first-class subsystem

Context exhaustion is not an error. It is a lifecycle event with a defined protocol.
Compaction creates a cheaper derived context layer without destroying source history.

```rust
struct Compaction {
    id: CompactionId,
    worker_id: WorkerId,
    task_id: Option<TaskId>,
    source_turns: Vec<TurnId>,
    summary: String,
    retained_facts: Vec<Fact>,
    retained_artifacts: Vec<ArtifactRef>,
    supersedes: Vec<ContextFragmentId>,
    token_before: u32,
    token_after: u32,
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}
```

Lifecycle triggers:

```
context 70%  -> prepare compaction (build summary in background)
context 85%  -> compact (swap full history for compacted representation)
context 95%  -> checkpoint + new session
new session  -> hydrate: task state + compacted history + unresolved work
```

**Source history is never replaced by compaction.** The original turns, messages,
logs, and artifacts remain in the DB. Compaction produces a `ContextFragment` with
`source: Compacted` that the context assembler (Invariant 16) uses instead of the
originals, but a worker or human can always drill into the full source.

Worker identity and task assignment survive session replacement. The worker is
durable (Invariant 1); the session is ephemeral. A new session hydrates from the
compacted context and continues where the previous session left off.

### Invariant 32: Universal search without embeddings

A single search API spans every entity in the system. Basic search works completely
offline without spending tokens.

```
GET /api/search?q=rate+limited+anthropic+AR-421
```

Searchable entities:

```
tasks, messages, workers, groups, turns, logs, tool calls,
verification evidence, gate evaluations, memories, files,
browser history/artifacts, email, calendar, CRM, schedules, events
```

Each result carries provenance:

```rust
struct SearchHit {
    entity_type: EntityType,
    entity_id: EntityId,
    scope: Scope,
    task_id: Option<TaskId>,
    worker_id: Option<WorkerId>,
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    snippet: String,
    score: f32,
}
```

Search stack (no embeddings required for the first three tiers):

```
exact/filter lookup       — id, status, type, date range
        ↓
SQLite indexes            — indexed columns, foreign keys
        ↓
FTS5 lexical search       — full-text across all entities, offline
        ↓
optional semantic search  — embedding-based reranking (token cost, online only)
```

SQLite FTS5 is the baseline. `rate limited anthropic AR-421` works offline, instantly,
without spending tokens. Semantic search is an optional layer on top for fuzzy/concept
queries, with locally-generated and cached embeddings.

### The history/context layer

Invariants 29-32 are not four random features. They form one cohesive layer:

```
                  SEARCH (Inv 32)
                    ▲
                    │
 ┌────────┬─────────┼───────────┬──────────┐
 │        │         │           │          │
Issues  Messages   Events      Logs      Artifacts
(Inv 3) (Inv 29)  (Inv 30)   (Inv 30)
 │        │         │           │          │
 └────────┴─────────┼───────────┴──────────┘
                    │
               COMPACTION (Inv 31)
                    │
                    ▼
             Worker Context (Inv 16/27)
```

Two governing principles:

> **Everything produced by amux is durable, attributable, searchable, and selectively
> compactable. Original source data is never replaced by compaction.**

> **A user can navigate from any entity to any related entity without knowing where
> it was stored.** Clicking a gate evaluation reaches the tool call, the turn, the
> worker output, and the message that triggered the work.

### Invariant 42: Memory is a durable, scoped, revisioned entity

Memory is the largest architectural gap the commit history exposes. The recurring
pattern:

```
canonical state (worker memory)
     |
generated representation (MEMORY.md, compacted summary)
     |
gets read back as canonical
     |
old/generated data overwrites newer source
```

or:

```
worker A memory --+
                  +-> shared file -> last writer wins
worker B memory --+
```

The fix: memory is a first-class entity in SQLite, not a file.

```rust
struct MemoryEntry {
    id: MemoryId,
    scope: Scope,              // global, group, or worker
    name: String,              // kebab-case slug, unique within scope
    content: String,
    memory_type: MemoryType,   // user, feedback, project, reference
    version: u64,              // entity version (Invariant 35)
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    deleted_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,  // soft delete, never lose history
    provenance: Provenance,    // who created/updated this and why
}
```

The canonical store is the `memory_entries` table. Everything else is derived
(Invariant 39):

```
SQLite MemoryEntry (canonical)
      |
      +-> search index (FTS5, Invariant 32)
      +-> worker context (assembled by context pipeline, Invariant 27)
      +-> compacted summary (lossy, Invariant 31)
      +-> MEMORY.md projection (generated file, read-only)
      +-> inter-worker API response (read from DB)

NONE of these write back to MemoryEntry without an explicit user mutation.
```

Scope isolation: a worker's memory is private to that worker. Group memory is
shared within the group. Global memory is visible to all. The scope resolver
(Invariant 2) determines which memories a worker sees at context assembly time.

Compaction may summarize old memories for prompt assembly (Invariant 31), but the
original `MemoryEntry` rows are never deleted or overwritten by compaction. The
compacted summary is a separate entity type (`CompactedContext`) that references
the source entries by ID.

Additive merging, deletion tracking, and concurrent writes are all handled by
the entity version + optimistic concurrency (Invariant 35). Two workers writing
to the same memory entry get a 409 conflict, not last-writer-wins.

### Invariant 43: Worker configuration is mutable; worker identity is not

A worker can change its display name, working directory, provider, model, backend,
environment, permissions, group, and automation preferences without creating a new
worker. The `WorkerId` is immutable. Everything else is configuration.

#### Config change classification

```rust
enum ConfigApplyMode {
    Immediate,           // applied to the running session now
    NextTurn,            // applied when the current turn ends
    SessionRestart,      // requires terminating and replacing the session
}
```

| Field | Apply mode |
|---|---|
| `display_name` | Immediate |
| `group` | Immediate |
| `permissions` | Immediate |
| `schedules` | Immediate |
| `automation_prefs` | Immediate |
| `model` (same provider, provider supports hot-switch) | NextTurn |
| `context_policy` | NextTurn |
| `tool_availability` | NextTurn |
| `cwd` | SessionRestart |
| `provider` | SessionRestart |
| `model` (provider requires process-level selection) | SessionRestart |
| `backend` | SessionRestart |
| `environment` (affecting process startup) | SessionRestart |

The API response for a config change declares which mode was used:

```rust
struct ConfigChangeResult {
    applied: ConfigApplyMode,
    worker: Worker,                // updated entity
    session_replaced: bool,        // true if a new session was spawned
    old_session_id: Option<SessionId>,
    new_session_id: Option<SessionId>,
}
```

#### Session replacement (atomic)

When a config change requires `SessionRestart`:

```
old session running
       |
checkpoint current turn/context
       |
spawn new session with updated config
       |
health/ready check on new session
       |
switch worker.current_session_id
       |
terminate old session
```

The worker never disappears during reconfiguration. If the new session fails to
start, the old session remains active and the config change is rejected.

**A config change restarts the session when necessary, never replaces the worker.**
The following remain unchanged across any config mutation:

```
WorkerId, tasks, messages, memory, turn history, gates,
schedules, metrics, search identity, audit history
```

#### Per-task model override

Workers have a default model. Individual tasks can request a different model
without changing the worker default:

```rust
struct TaskHints {
    requested_model: Option<ModelId>,  // override worker default for this task
    // ...
}
```

After the task completes, the worker returns to its configured model. This
supports the orchestrator's cost optimization: route expensive tasks to capable
models while keeping worker defaults economical.

#### Rename and alias

Display names can change instantly (Immediate). Backend process identifiers
derive from immutable `WorkerId` (`format!("amux-{}", worker.id)`), so renaming
never affects the process host.

Old display names become aliases. `@backend` still resolves after renaming to
`@rust-backend` until the alias is explicitly removed. This makes `@worker`
addressing (Invariant 17) durable across renames.

```rust
// Name resolution priority:
// 1. Exact match on display_name
// 2. Exact match on any alias
// 3. Prefix match on display_name (if unambiguous)
fn resolve_worker_name(name: &str, workers: &[Worker]) -> Option<WorkerId>;
```

#### Working directory

`cwd` is an explicit field in `WorkerConfig`, distinct from `FsScope`
(authorization/capability). `cwd` is where the process starts; `FsScope` is what
it is allowed to access.

```
PATCH /api/workers/:id/config
{ "cwd": "/Users/ethan/code/mixpeek", "base_rev": 17 }

Response:
{ "applied": "session_restart", "session_replaced": true, ... }
```

### Invariant 44: UI interaction coverage

**Every interactive UI element has an executable interaction contract. Every
contract is exercised in at least one E2E path, including resulting state, error,
toast, navigation, or mutation. A new interactive control without a registered
behavioral test fails CI.**

Coverage is measured over interaction edges, not rendered components. A component
is not considered tested merely because it appeared on screen.

```
Button rendered         != tested
Button clicked          != tested
Click -> mutation -> server result -> UI reconciliation = tested
```

#### Stable semantic test IDs

Every interactive element exposes a stable semantic identifier. Tests never use
CSS selectors like `div:nth-child(3) > button:nth-child(2)` or rely solely on
visible copy (wording changes must not break behavioral tests).

```html
<button data-testid="task-menu" data-entity-id="AR-421">
<input data-testid="task-title-input" data-entity-id="AR-421" />
```

The instrumented set (all must have `data-testid` or `data-action-id`):

```
button, a[href], input, select, textarea,
[role=button], [role=tab], [role=menuitem],
[tabindex], [data-action]
```

#### Interaction contracts

Each reusable component has a machine-readable registry of capabilities:

```rust
struct UiContract {
    component: String,
    actions: Vec<UiAction>,
    observable_results: Vec<ObservableResult>,
}

struct UiAction {
    name: String,                      // "edit", "move", "archive"
    testid: String,                    // data-testid value
    input_type: InputType,             // Click, TextEntry, DragDrop, ...
}

enum ObservableResult {
    EntityUpdated { entity_type: EntityType },
    Toast { kind: ToastKind },
    ModalOpen { component: String },
    Navigation { to: String },
    Error { kind: ErrorKind },
    StateTransition { from: String, to: String },
}
```

#### Standard interaction matrix

Every interactive control is tested against this matrix:

| Interaction | Must test |
|---|---|
| click | normal result |
| double click | no duplicate mutation |
| keyboard | Enter/Space works |
| text entry | normal + empty + long + Unicode |
| submit | button + Enter |
| loading | control disabled/indicates pending |
| success | state updates + correct toast |
| server error | error shown, local state sane |
| validation error | field feedback |
| 409 conflict | reconciliation UI (Invariant 35) |
| offline | queued/disabled behavior (Invariant 14) |
| reconnect | eventually converges |
| rapid repeat | idempotent |
| navigation away | pending state handled |
| back/forward | state restored correctly |

#### UI as a state graph

The UI is modeled as a graph of reachable states and transitions:

```
Page/View
  +-- Component
      +-- Control
          +-- Action
              +-- Resulting state
                  +-- Next available controls
```

Example -- full nested path:

```
Board
 +-- Task card
     +-- ... menu
         +-- Move
             +-- column picker
                 +-- choose Review
                     +-- gate modal appears
                         +-- enter acknowledgement
                             +-- press Enter
                                 +-- loading state
                                 +-- server accepts
                                 +-- modal closes
                                 +-- card moves
                                 +-- toast appears
                                 +-- SSE revision arrives
                                 +-- card remains in correct column
```

Not just "PATCH /api/board worked."

#### State-machine-based UI testing

Complex components define legal states and transitions:

```typescript
type TaskModalState =
    | "closed"
    | "viewing"
    | "editing"
    | "saving"
    | "gate_blocked"
    | "conflict"
    | "error";
```

Generated action sequences test that no sequence leaves the component in an
impossible state:

```
open -> edit -> type -> save -> server_409 -> ack_gate -> save -> close -> reopen
```

#### Model-based testing

Model state and browser state are kept in sync:

```
Model state              Browser state
-----------              -------------
task.status=review  <=> card appears in Review column
modal=open           <=> modal visible in DOM
saving=true          <=> save button disabled/spinner
offline=true         <=> queued indicator visible
```

After every action: `await assertBrowserMatchesModel()`. This catches cases where
the DOM is correct but rendering is wrong, or the server is correct but client
state is stale.

#### Interaction telemetry

Every E2E step automatically captures:

```json
{
    "interaction_id": "int_92871",
    "test_id": "board_move_with_gate",
    "component": "TaskCard",
    "action": "press_enter",
    "target": "task-title-input",
    "entity": "AR-421",
    "server_rev_before": 8821,
    "server_rev_after": 8822,
    "network": [
        { "method": "PATCH", "path": "/api/board/AR-421", "status": 200 }
    ],
    "toast": "Task updated",
    "console_errors": [],
    "duration_ms": 142
}
```

This feeds the existing structured event ledger (Invariant 30), not a separate
logging system.

#### Visual state assertions

DOM/state assertions for most behavior:

```
visible, enabled, selected, value,
aria-expanded, aria-pressed,
row/card location, toast text
```

Screenshot checks for geometry-dependent cases:

```
mobile menus, drawers, drag/drop, board columns,
tooltips, popovers, modals, responsive layout,
sticky headers
```

For important containers, assert geometry (catches `height: 0` bugs that
DOM-only assertions miss):

```typescript
const box = await locator.boundingBox();
expect(box?.height).toBeGreaterThan(44);
```

#### Real user mechanics

Test all input modalities:

```
mouse, touch, keyboard, mobile viewport (375px),
scroll, pinch, drag/drop, long lists,
browser back, page refresh, tab sleep/wake
```

Board drag interactions tested as full transactions:

```
pointerDown(card) -> pointerMove(column) -> drop
-> optimistic card move
-> API request
-> response
-> authoritative SSE/revision
-> final card location matches backend
```

And the failure path:

```
drop -> 409 gate failure
-> card returns to original column
-> gate toast/modal
-> no phantom local move
```

#### Fault injection hooks (test mode only)

Internal test harness controls for systematic failure testing:

```rust
struct TestFaults {
    next_board_patch: Option<u16>,     // e.g. 500
    sse_drop_every: Option<u32>,       // drop every Nth event
    latency_ms: Option<u64>,           // added latency
    next_request_status: Option<u16>,  // e.g. 409
    offline_after: Option<u32>,        // go offline after N requests
}
```

Available only when compiled with `#[cfg(test)]` or `--test-mode` flag.
Never exposed in production. Enables systematic testing of:

```
slow response, timeout, 500, 409, duplicate response,
dropped SSE, out-of-order SSE, offline mid-submit,
server restart mid-modal, worker disappears while menu open
```

#### CI interaction coverage report

```

Controls exercised E2E:           481
Missing coverage:                   6  <- CI FAILS
```

A Playwright helper crawls the rendered DOM across all reachable UI states,
records every `data-testid`/`data-action-id`, and diffs against the interaction
contract registry. New interactive controls without coverage fail CI:

```
UNTESTED INTERACTION:
  data-testid="worker-change-model"

No E2E test exercised:
  WorkerSettings -> change_model
```

### Design rule: self-documenting by construction

The system is its own documentation. No separate design doc, wiki, or README should
be required to understand what the system does, how it works, or why a decision was
made. This is enforced structurally, not by discipline:

1. **Types ARE the spec.** `WorkerCommand`, `WorkerEvent`, `BoardTransition`,
   `VerifierKind`, `StallReason`, `ProviderState` -- reading the enum variants tells
   you exactly what the system can do. No prose description of "supported commands"
   that drifts from the code.

2. **API contract IS the documentation.** `JsonSchema` derives generate the OpenAPI
   spec from the same structs that handle requests. The spec cannot disagree with the
   implementation because it IS the implementation. `/api/spec.json` is always current.

3. **Error messages ARE the user guide.** Gate rejections return the exact gate
   criteria, the missing evidence, and the CLI command to satisfy them (Invariant 18).
   A 409 body teaches you what to do next. `why-blocked` returns the full chain.
   No separate "troubleshooting" doc.

4. **Event history IS the audit trail.** `DurableEvent` (Invariant 24) means every
   state transition is queryable: `amux task AR-123 history` shows who did what,
   when, and why. No separate audit log to maintain.

5. **Test names ARE the requirements.** Each Playwright golden scenario and each
   proptest property IS a requirement. If the test passes, the requirement is met. If
   the test is missing, the requirement is unspecified.

6. **Config structure IS the admin guide.** Four-tier scope (Invariant 2) with
   `effective_config` means there is one way to configure anything, and
   `amux config show --effective --worker=X` shows exactly what is in effect and where
   each value came from (org, global, group, or worker override).

7. **The dependency graph IS the project plan.** `TaskRelation` (Invariant 4) means
   the board itself shows what blocks what. No separate Gantt chart or project tracker.

The bar: a new contributor should be able to understand the system by reading types,
running tests, and querying the API -- without opening a single markdown file.

### Invariant 45: Autonomous execution -- the plan is executable, not advisory

An implementation agent given only this document and the instruction `execute` must be
able to continue from the current repository state until every acceptance criterion is
verified. It must not require a human to repeatedly tell it what to do next.

The agent loop:

1. Inspect the repository and current implementation state.
2. Read this document.
3. Find the first incomplete item in the Execution Checklist (§Execution Checklist).
4. Implement it.
5. Run its required tests.
6. Repair failures.
7. Collect evidence.
8. Mark it `VERIFIED` only after all applicable acceptance criteria pass.
9. Commit progress.
10. Continue to the next runnable item (dependencies satisfied, not blocked).
11. Repeat until the checklist contains no incomplete items.

Human input is appropriate only when genuinely blocked on something external that
cannot be safely inferred or tested: unavailable credentials, an irreversible business
decision, or access to a system the agent cannot reach. Ordinary implementation
uncertainty is NOT a reason to stop -- the agent should inspect the existing Python
behavior, tests, database, browser behavior, Git history, APIs, and current Rust
implementation and make the best evidence-supported decision.

```rust
enum BlockerKind {
    ImplementationFailure,  // fix and continue -- never stop
    TestFailure,            // fix and continue -- never stop
    ExternalBlocker {       // credential, service, hardware
        what: String,
        evidence: String,
        attempted: Vec<String>,
        independent_work_remains: bool,
        retry_schedule: RetrySchedule,
        max_age: Duration,
    },
    PolicyDecision {        // ambiguous choice with a pre-committed default
        decision: String,
        chosen: String,
        rationale: String,
        reversible: bool,
    },
    AmendmentProposed {     // agent wants to weaken a hashed invariant clause
        invariant: InvariantId,
        proposal: String,
        // Never self-resolving. Agent records in docs/proposed-amendments.md
        // and moves to other runnable work. If no independent work remains,
        // circuit opens with AllItemsBlocked (Invariant 48).
    },
}

struct RetrySchedule {
    interval: Duration,
    max_attempts: u32,
    check: VerifierKind,    // machine-checkable re-entry condition
}
```

There is no `HumanDecisionRequired`. An agent that can stop will find reasons to.
Every ambiguous choice has a pre-committed default (see the policy defaults table
below). The agent picks the default, records the decision as a `DurableEvent`
(`EventKind::PolicyDecisionMade`), and continues. If the decision later proves wrong,
it is reversible by amending the policy table and reopening the affected items.

`ImplementationFailure` and `TestFailure` never justify stopping. An `ExternalBlocker`
creates a structured checklist entry, carries a `RetrySchedule` with a
machine-checkable condition, and continues all unrelated runnable items. When
`max_age` expires without resolution, the blocker becomes `Quarantined` (see
Invariant 47). If the checklist reaches a state where EVERY remaining item is blocked, the
circuit opens with `CircuitOpenReason::AllItemsBlocked` (Invariant 48 owns this
event and the subsequent reconciliation loop -- see Invariant 48 for the full
protocol).

A single blocked integration must never halt the entire rebuild.

#### Policy defaults table

Every foreseeable ambiguous decision has a pre-committed default. The agent uses the
default without stopping. Decisions not in this table use the meta-default: choose
the option that preserves more data, is more reversible, and matches existing Python
behavior.

| Decision domain | Default | Rationale | Reversible |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ambiguous schema mapping (column purpose unclear) | Migrate as-is with `legacy_` prefix | Preserves data; rename is cheap | Yes |
| Gate semantics (which gates apply to a new type) | Derive from closest existing type | Matches user expectation | Yes |
| Deprecation vs. transform (table/column unused in Python) | Transform with preservation | Data loss is irreversible | Yes |
| Dependency version (multiple compatible versions) | Latest stable | Security + maintenance | Yes |
| Naming collision (Rust reserved word, duplicate after rename) | Append `_field` suffix | Unambiguous, greppable | Yes |
| Enum variant ordering (no natural order) | Alphabetical | Deterministic, diffable | Yes |
| Missing foreign key (implicit relationship in Python) | Add FK with `ON DELETE SET NULL` | Preserves referential integrity without cascade risk | Yes |
| Ambiguous NULL semantics (Python uses empty string and NULL interchangeably) | Normalize to `Option<T>` with NULL | Explicit, queryable | Yes |
| Event kind classification (Python log line doesn't map cleanly to EventKind) | `EventKind::Extension(raw)` | Preserves original; reclassify later | Yes |
| Provider-specific behavior (Python has provider-specific codepath) | Abstract behind trait; if unclear, Claude-first | Most-tested provider | Yes |
| Config key conflict (Python has conflicting keys at different scopes) | Worker scope wins (most specific) | Matches existing resolver behavior | Yes |
| Test flakiness (test passes 90% of the time) | Mark `#[flaky]`, quarantine after 3 consecutive failures; quarantine creates a task linked to the test's `INV-xxx` tag; linked invariant cannot reach `VERIFIED` while test is quarantined | Doesn't block progress; doesn't hide real failures | Yes |
| API response shape ambiguity (Python returns inconsistent shapes) | Union type with discriminator field | Backwards compatible; clients handle both | Yes |
| Scope of a feature (unclear if global or group-scoped) | Group-scoped | Narrower default; widening is safe, narrowing breaks | Yes |

**Progress rules:**

At startup and after every completed item:
1. Read the Execution Checklist.
2. Reconcile checklist against actual repository/test state.
3. Never trust stale `VERIFIED` markers if current tests fail -- reopen the item.
4. Choose the first/highest-priority runnable non-verified item whose dependencies are
   all `VERIFIED`.
5. Work it to verification.
6. Record evidence.
7. Update checklist status.
8. Commit.
9. Continue.

The checklist is a projection of reality, not a substitute for reality. If the
checklist says `VERIFIED` but acceptance tests fail, the item is automatically reopened.

**Ownership and parallelism:**

If the implementation agent decomposes work to multiple workers:
- Each checklist item has one current owner/lease at a time.
- Workers may not implement the same item concurrently unless explicitly decomposed
  into child items.
- Child items link to parent.
- Ownership expires/reconciles after crashes.
- All worker output eventually resolves into the checklist item and its verification
  evidence.

This uses the same board/lease philosophy amux itself implements (Invariant 3/34).

### Invariant 46: UX path discovery generates the browser acceptance test plan

Do not manually guess the complete browser test surface. Discover it from the running
product, turn the discovered UX graph into the acceptance plan, and preserve that
graph as a permanent regression contract.

The manually-written golden scenarios in this document answer **"what is this path
supposed to mean?"**. Automatic UX discovery answers **"what paths exist?"**. Both are
required. The acceptance suite must be capable of finding a UI path the author of this
document forgot existed.

**The UX interaction graph:**

A dedicated UX discovery harness starts AMUX against deterministic test fixtures and
automatically explores every reachable user-facing surface by recursively discovering
visible actions, executing them, observing the resulting UI state, and discovering
newly available actions.

```rust
struct UiState {
    id: UiStateId,
    route: String,
    visible_components: Vec<ComponentId>,
    modal_stack: Vec<ComponentId>,
    entity_context: Vec<EntityRef>,
    state_hash: Hash,  // semantic, not raw HTML
}

struct UiAction {
    id: UiActionId,
    source_state: UiStateId,
    target: SemanticLocator,
    action: ActionKind,
    expected_effects: Vec<ExpectedEffect>,
}

enum ActionKind {
    Click,
    DoubleClick,
    Type { value_class: InputClass },
    Press { key: Key },
    Select { option: String },
    Toggle,
    DragDrop { destination: SemanticLocator },
    Scroll,
    OpenContextMenu,
    Close,
    Back,
    Forward,
    Refresh,
}

struct UiEdge {
    from: UiStateId,
    action: UiActionId,
    to: UiStateId,
}
```

The graph represents `state -> user action -> resulting state`, not merely an
inventory of DOM nodes.

**Semantic state hashing.** Raw HTML must not be the state identity. Normalize
volatile values (timestamps, random IDs, animation classes, transient DOM attributes)
before hashing. State identity reflects meaningful user-visible structure: route,
active tab, open modal/drawer/menu, selected entity, visible controls, relevant
entity states, form mode, error/loading/offline state.

**Interactive control discovery.** At every discovered state, inspect: `button`,
`a[href]`, `input`, `textarea`, `select`, `[role=button]`, `[role=menuitem]`,
`[role=tab]`, `[role=checkbox]`, `[role=switch]`, `[role=radio]`, `[role=option]`,
`[contenteditable]`, `[tabindex]`, `[data-action]`, `[data-testid]`, draggable
elements. Also inspect controls revealed only by hover, focus, right-click/context
menu, scroll, responsive layout, overflow menus, nested dropdowns, drawers, modals,
tabs, accordions, expandable cards, and keyboard shortcuts.

**State-aware safe exploration.** Discovery is NOT random clicking. The crawler
understands action classes and uses appropriate generated fixture data:
- Text inputs: normal, empty, unicode, long, invalid
- Selects: each semantically-distinct option
- Toggles: false->true, true->false
- Modals: open, primary action, secondary action, close button, Escape, outside-click
- Forms: valid submit, required-field omission, invalid value, keyboard Enter, cancel,
  server rejection, reload with unsaved data, offline submit, duplicate submit

**Seed states.** Discovery must not begin only from the empty/default application.
Create deterministic fixtures for: empty installation, populated installation,
migrated Python dataset, worker active/idle/stopped/rate-limited/errored/high-context/
unread-messages, task in each lifecycle state (todo/doing/review/gate-blocked/done/
verified/dependency-blocked), offline client, pending offline mutations, sync conflict,
provider unavailable, Herdr unavailable, schedule enabled/disabled, browser profile
active/locked. Run UX discovery from each relevant seed. A button that only appears
when a worker is rate-limited must be discovered.

**Scope and role discovery.** Run discovery across every applicable permission/scope
context: global, group, worker, admin, ordinary user.

**Desktop/mobile discovery.** Generate separate UX graphs where responsive behavior
differs. At minimum: desktop Chromium and mobile viewport + touch. Responsive UIs
may expose different paths.

**Offline graph discovery.** Repeat applicable exploration with the browser offline.
Classify discovered actions as: works_offline, queues_offline, read_only_cached,
disabled_offline, unexpected_failure. Then reconnect and discover the reconciliation
path (edit offline -> queued indicator -> reconnect -> syncing -> server accepts ->
toast -> authoritative state).

**Network/result-state discovery.** The same action can produce multiple legitimate
result states. For mutation actions, explore applicable outcomes via deterministic
fault injection: success, validation failure, 401/403, 404, 409 conflict/gate, 429,
500, timeout, offline, server restart. Thus `TaskCard -> Move -> Review` may have
edges to: success (Review column), 409 (Gate modal), offline (queued), 500 (error
toast + original state). All are separate UX paths requiring coverage.

**Deep exploration.** Discovery must recurse through nested interactions:
`Workers -> card -> more menu -> Settings -> Runtime -> Model selector -> choose ->
Save -> session replacement -> status transition -> success toast`. A test that merely
reaches Settings does NOT cover this path. The graph retains each interaction edge.

**Control path explosion.** Do not require testing every arbitrary sequence. Use graph
algorithms for meaningful coverage:
1. 100% reachable semantic action coverage
2. 100% known result-state edge coverage for critical mutations
3. 100% component-state coverage for critical components
4. Shortest-path coverage to each state/action by default
5. Additional cycles for stateful behaviors (toggle, offline/reconnect, archive/restore)

Use BFS/shortest-path exploration, bounded depth, and semantic state deduplication.

**Generated test plan.** After discovery, produce machine-readable artifacts:

```
target/ux/interaction-graph.json    — full UX graph
target/ux/interaction-coverage.json — coverage analysis
target/ux/generated-test-plan.md    — discovered test requirements
```

Generated Playwright scenarios use a data-driven runner where practical:
```typescript
for (const scenario of discoveredScenarios) {
    test(scenario.name, async ({ page }) => {
        await executeScenario(page, scenario);
        await assertExpectedEffects(page, scenario);
    });
}
```
Hand-written tests remain for complex/high-value flows. The discovered graph
guarantees completeness.

**Reconciliation with the RR checklist.** The autonomous executor must compare:
spec requirements + RR checklist + automatically discovered UX graph. No one source
is sufficient. If UX discovery finds functionality not represented by an RR item,
automatically create or flag a checklist item before final acceptance. If an RR item
claims a UI feature that discovery cannot reach, that is an acceptance failure.

**UX graph baseline.** Commit a normalized UX contract/baseline to the repository
(e.g. `tests/ux/contract.json`). Generated screenshots/logs remain build artifacts.
This baseline represents the accepted reachable UX surface. Updating it requires
corresponding test changes. Never automatically approve a changed graph simply
because the crawler discovered it -- discovery detects product-surface changes; tests
decide whether they are correct.

**Permanent discovery in CI/CD.** After the Rust rebuild is accepted, UX discovery
remains part of CI. For every PR: run app with fixture -> discover UX graph -> compare
with baseline. Classify changes: new state, new action, removed state, removed action,
changed transition, changed expected effect. Any unexplained graph change fails CI.
This makes the UI itself a test-contract source.

**Crawler self-test.** Because acceptance depends on automatic discovery, verify the
discovery harness itself. Create fixture pages with intentionally hidden nested
controls, hover controls, keyboard-only actions, modals, scroll-revealed controls,
dropdowns, invalid forms, duplicate-looking controls, responsive-only controls. Assert
the crawler discovers every expected action and state. A discovery system that silently
misses paths is worse than no discovery because it creates false confidence.

**Behavioral coverage.** An edge is verified only when its expected consequences are
observed. For mutations: action -> UI pending/optimistic state -> request/command ->
authoritative backend result -> durable event/revision -> UI reconciliation -> expected
visible result -> refresh confirms persistence. For errors: action -> backend
rejection -> correct error/gate/conflict state -> toast/modal rendered -> no unintended
mutation -> retry path works where applicable.

**Discovery coverage report:**
```
States discovered:                 384
Semantic components:               127
Interactive controls:              693
Semantic actions:                  941
Transition edges:                1,483

Actions with test coverage:        941 / 941
Critical result edges:             312 / 312
Missing semantic IDs:                0
Unreachable registered actions:      0
Unspecified discovered actions:      0

Desktop coverage:                 PASS
Mobile coverage:                  PASS
Offline coverage:                 PASS
Fault-state coverage:             PASS
```

Final Rust acceptance requires zero unexplained holes.

### Invariant 47: Anti-livelock -- no-stall without no-thrash means burning tokens forever

No-stall (Invariant 10) guarantees forward motion. Without a complementary
no-thrash guarantee, the agent burns tokens retrying verification forever.
Every task carries execution limits:

```rust
struct ExecutionLimits {
    max_attempts: u32,           // default: 5
    max_cumulative_tokens: u64,  // default: 500_000
    max_wall_clock: Duration,    // default: 4 hours
    current_attempt: u32,
    tokens_spent: u64,
    started_at: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
}
```

On exhaustion of any limit:

1. **Automatic decomposition**: split the task into child tasks, each covering a
   smaller, independently verifiable piece. The children inherit the parent's
   acceptance criteria, narrowed to their scope. The parent moves to
   `Waiting(Dependency(...))` on the children.
2. If decomposition itself fails twice (children also exhaust their limits), the
   task moves to `Quarantined` with the full failure chain:

```rust
struct AttemptRecord {
    attempt: u32,
    failure_reason: String,
    rejected_evidence: Vec<String>,
    tokens_spent: u64,
    wall_clock: Duration,
    decomposition_attempted: bool,
}
```

`Quarantined` is terminal, counted in `FleetProgress` (L4), and reported in the
diagnostic output. It is never silently retried. The quarantine count is a
fleet-level health signal: rising quarantine count = systemic problem, not
bad luck on individual tasks.

### Invariant 48: Global spend and progress circuit breakers

`FleetProgress` (defined in L4 below) reports. This invariant makes it ACT.

```rust
struct FleetCircuitBreaker {
    zero_progress_hours: u32,        // default: 3
    window_budget: u64,              // tokens per rolling 4h window
    quarantine_threshold: u32,       // halt if N quarantines in 1h
}

enum FleetState {
    Normal,
    CircuitOpen {
        reason: CircuitOpenReason,
        diagnostic_report: DiagnosticReport,
        entered_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    },
    Reconciling,  // low-power: re-evaluate blocked items, audit progress
}

enum CircuitOpenReason {
    ZeroProgress { hours: u32, tokens_burned: u64 },
    BudgetExhausted { window_spend: u64, budget: u64 },
    QuarantineSurge { count: u32, period: Duration },
    AllItemsBlocked { blockers: Vec<(TaskId, BlockerKind)> },
}
```

**Interaction with Invariant 10 (no-stall guarantee):** `FleetState::CircuitOpen`
and `FleetState::Reconciling` **suspend `stall_check`**. The circuit breaker
deliberately produces idle workers with runnable tasks -- that is its job. Without
this suspension, the correct emergency behavior (halt assignments) trips the
cardinal acceptance criterion (idle worker + runnable tasks = system failure),
and the agent must resolve the contradiction by either ignoring the circuit
breaker or ignoring the stall check. Neither is correct.

```rust
fn stall_check(worker: &Worker, board: &Board, fleet: &FleetState) -> Vec<StallViolation> {
    if matches!(fleet, FleetState::CircuitOpen { .. } | FleetState::Reconciling) {
        return vec![];  // stall check suspended during fleet emergency
    }
    // ... normal stall detection (Invariant 10)
}
```

**Interaction with Invariant 45 (autonomous execution):** Inv 45's "every
remaining item blocked -> terminal failure report" and Inv 48's
`CircuitOpenReason::AllItemsBlocked` describe the same event. The owner is
Invariant 48 (this section). When all items are blocked, the circuit opens
with `AllItemsBlocked`, which triggers the diagnostic report and reconciliation
loop described below. Invariant 45's agent loop enters the reconciliation
state rather than independently producing its own terminal failure report.

When the circuit opens:
1. The orchestrator halts new assignments.
2. Writes a diagnostic report: every in-progress task, every blocker, every
   quarantined item, token spend curve, last N completed items with their cost.
3. Enters a low-power reconciliation loop: re-evaluate all blocked items'
   conditions, audit whether any `ExternalBlocker.check` now passes, attempt
   unblocking anything whose condition changed.
4. If reconciliation finds runnable work, circuit closes automatically.
5. If reconciliation finds nothing after one full cycle, the fleet halts with a
   written report. This is the "stuck at the fleet level" signal.

### Invariant 49: Failure feeds forward -- retries are not re-rolls

Invariant 27 (context per attempt) snapshots context but nothing requires
attempt N+1 to see why N failed. Without this, retries are re-rolls, and
re-rolls are how autonomous systems spend $40k on the same bug.

```rust
struct WorkAssignment {
    task_id: TaskId,
    worker_id: WorkerId,
    attempt: u32,
    lease: Lease,
    context: WorkContext,
    idempotency_key: Uuid,
    prior_attempts: Vec<AttemptRecord>,   // MANDATORY for attempt > 1
}
```

`WorkContext` for attempt N must include:
- All prior attempts' failure reasons (from `AttemptRecord`)
- Rejected evidence (what was tried and why it didn't satisfy the gate)
- The specific verification failure message (not just "failed")
- Any decomposition that was attempted and its outcome

The agent receiving attempt 2+ is instructed: "Attempt N-1 failed because
[specific reason]. The following approaches were tried and rejected: [...].
Do not repeat them." This is enforced structurally -- the orchestrator
constructs the assignment with this context. The agent cannot opt out of
seeing it.

### Invariant 50: Acceptance criteria before execution, authored by a different worker

With no human reviewer, self-graded homework is the failure mode. Enforce
structurally:

```rust
struct AcceptanceCriteria {
    criteria: Vec<Criterion>,
    authored_by: WorkerId,
    authored_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    version: u32,
}

struct Criterion {
    id: CriterionId,
    description: String,
    verifier: VerifierKind,
    required: bool,
}
```

Rules:
1. A task cannot leave `todo` without at least one `Criterion`.
2. `AcceptanceCriteria.authored_by` must differ from the task's executor.
   Self-authored criteria are structurally rejected. `authored_by` is
   `CriteriaAuthor`, not `WorkerId`:

   ```rust
   enum CriteriaAuthor {
       Worker(WorkerId),     // a different worker wrote these
       Document,             // pre-authored by this plan document
   }
   ```

   **Bootstrap rule**: RR checklist items' acceptance criteria are
   pre-authored by this document (`authored_by: CriteriaAuthor::Document`),
   which satisfies the separation requirement by construction. The criteria
   are the `Requirement` and `Tests` fields of each RR item. Invariant 50's
   `CriteriaReviewer` role applies only to tasks the agent creates at
   runtime -- decompositions (Invariant 47), discovered items (Invariant 46),
   and auto-captured prompts.

3. Post-start criteria edits are a distinct audited transition
   (`EventKind::CriteriaAmended`) that resets verification status to
   `needs_reverification`. The executor sees the amendment on their next
   tick.
4. A dedicated adversarial reviewer worker (`WorkerRole::CriteriaReviewer`)
   exists whose only job is rejecting under-specified criteria. It runs
   before the executor starts, not after they finish. Under-specified =
   no `VerifierKind`, or verifier is `Manual` when a `Deterministic`
   check exists, or criterion is not falsifiable ("works correctly").
5. **Reviewer round cap**: the `CriteriaReviewer` may reject criteria at
   most 3 times per task. On the third rejection, the criteria are accepted
   with a `PolicyDecisionMade` event recording the reviewer's objections
   and a `review_rounds_exhausted: true` flag. This prevents an unbounded
   reject loop (Invariant 47 limits the executor; this limits the reviewer).

### Invariant 51: Decomposition depth cap

Auto-decomposition (Invariant 47) + auto-creation from prompts + agent-created
checklist items (Invariant 46 says discovery can create RR items) form an
unbounded work generator. Cap it:

```rust
const MAX_DECOMPOSITION_DEPTH: u32 = 3;
const MAX_CHILDREN_PER_TASK: u32 = 10;
const MAX_DISCOVERED_ITEMS_PER_RUN: u32 = 50;
```

Rules:
1. **Depth limit**: a task created by decomposition carries
   `decomposition_depth: u32`. Children inherit `parent_depth + 1`. At
   `MAX_DECOMPOSITION_DEPTH`, exhaustion leads directly to `Quarantined`,
   not further decomposition.
2. **Child count limit**: a single decomposition produces at most
   `MAX_CHILDREN_PER_TASK` children. If the natural split is larger,
   group related children under intermediate parents.
3. **Discovered items link to a gated parent**: items created by UX discovery
   (Invariant 46) or any automated discovery process must link to a parent
   task that is `VERIFIED`-gated. The parent cannot verify until all
   discovered children verify. This prevents discovered items from
   floating free with no completion gate. For top-level crawls (e.g., the
   Phase 8 full-dashboard UX crawl), the parent is the RR item that
   triggered the crawl (e.g., RR-0101). That RR item cannot reach `VERIFIED`
   until all discovered children verify -- this is correct and intentional.
4. **Per-run cap**: a single discovery run (UX crawl, schema scan, etc.)
   creates at most `MAX_DISCOVERED_ITEMS_PER_RUN` items. If more are found,
   the run completes with a report of what was capped, and a follow-up
   discovery is scheduled.

### Invariant 52: Capability policy replaces approval gates

No action gates on human approval. Instead, a typed capability policy loaded
at startup defines what the agent may do, at what rate, and under what
conditions:

```rust
struct CapabilityPolicy {
    profile: DeploymentProfile,
    capabilities: Vec<CapabilityRule>,
}

enum DeploymentProfile {
    Personal,    // local dev machine, single user
    Cloud,       // multi-tenant, per-user isolation
    Concierge,   // managed service, external-facing
}

struct CapabilityRule {
    action: ActionClass,
    constraint: CapabilityConstraint,
}

enum ActionClass {
    GitPush { branch_pattern: String },
    SendEmail,
    ExternalApiWrite { service: String },
    DeleteData { scope: Scope },
    // SpendMoney removed -- token spend is a continuous metered resource governed
    // by FleetCircuitBreaker.window_budget (Invariant 48), not a discrete action.
    CreateWorker,
    ModifySchedule,
    DatabaseMigration,
}

enum CapabilityConstraint {
    Allowed,
    RateLimited { max_per_hour: u32 },
    DryRunFirst,       // mandatory dry-run + evidence step, then execute
    SandboxOnly,       // execute in sandbox, never production
    RequiresEvidence { verifier: VerifierKind },
    Denied,
}
```

The `DeploymentProfile` selects the default policy. Per-action overrides are
loaded from `~/.amux/capability-policy.toml`. This is also the mechanism that
distinguishes personal/cloud/concierge deployments -- one construct, two jobs.

**Enforcement chokepoint**: every `ActionClass` invocation routes through
`CapabilityPolicy::check(action, context) -> CapabilityVerdict` before
execution. This is a single function, not per-call-site checks. Any action
site that bypasses `policy.check()` is a CI failure -- the `#[must_use]`
return type and a lint pass that greps for unguarded action invocations
enforce this structurally. Unrouted action sites fail CI the way untested
`data-testid`s do (Invariant 44).

```rust
enum CapabilityVerdict {
    Proceed,
    DryRunFirst { dry_run_fn: DryRunFn },
    RateLimited { retry_after: Duration },
    Denied { reason: String },
}
```

**`DryRunFirst` definitions per action class:**

| ActionClass | DryRun behavior |
|---|---|
| `GitPush` | `git push --dry-run` -- records refs that would update |
| `SendEmail` | Render message to `DurableEvent`, no SMTP delivery |
| `ExternalApiWrite` | Log request body + endpoint, no HTTP call |
| `DeleteData` | List affected rows/keys, no deletion |
| `SpendMoney` | N/A -- see below |
| `DatabaseMigration` | Run against in-memory DB clone, diff schema |

**`SpendMoney` unification with Invariant 48:** `SpendMoney` as an `ActionClass`
and `window_budget` in `FleetCircuitBreaker` are two spend controls -- an
Invariant 36 violation. Resolution: `SpendMoney` is removed from `ActionClass`.
Token spend is governed solely by `FleetCircuitBreaker.window_budget` (Invariant
48), which is the fleet-level mechanism. `ActionClass` governs discrete
side-effecting actions; token spend is a continuous metered resource, not a
discrete action.

Irreversible actions (`SendEmail`, `GitPush`, `DeleteData`) get `DryRunFirst`
by default: the agent executes the dry-run variant, records the evidence as a
`DurableEvent`, and then executes for real. No approval gate, but a mandatory
evidence trail.

### Invariant 53: Terminology is opt-in and backward-compatible

The vernacular rename (session -> worker, issue -> task) must not break
existing users. Every consumer of the amux API -- scripts, hooks, CLI
muscle memory, dashboard bookmarks, CLAUDE.md instructions referencing
`/api/sessions`, board cards with `session` fields -- must keep working
without modification. The new terminology is the *default for new
installations*; existing deployments adopt it at their own pace.

**API routes**: both old and new paths are served. The canonical (new)
routes are `/api/workers`, `/api/tasks`. The legacy routes `/api/sessions`,
`/api/issues` are aliases that resolve to the same handlers. A
`Deprecated` response header on legacy routes signals the rename without
breaking callers. There is no removal timeline in the Rust rebuild --
aliases are permanent until a future major version.

```rust
// axum route registration -- aliases are first-class, not middleware hacks
fn register_board_routes(router: Router) -> Router {
    let handler = board_handler();
    router
        .route("/api/tasks", handler.clone())
        .route("/api/issues", handler.clone())  // legacy alias
        .route("/api/tasks/:id", detail_handler.clone())
        .route("/api/issues/:id", detail_handler.clone())
}

fn register_worker_routes(router: Router) -> Router {
    let handler = worker_handler();
    router
        .route("/api/workers", handler.clone())
        .route("/api/sessions", handler.clone())  // legacy alias
        .route("/api/workers/:id", detail_handler.clone())
        .route("/api/sessions/:id", detail_handler.clone())
}
```

**API response fields**: JSON responses include both field names.
`session` and `worker` both appear in board task responses, carrying
the same value. A pref (`api_field_style`: `"modern"` | `"legacy"` |
`"both"`) controls which fields are emitted:

- `"both"` (default): `{"session": "wrk-1", "worker": "wrk-1", ...}`
- `"modern"`: `{"worker": "wrk-1", ...}` (no `session` field)
- `"legacy"`: `{"session": "wrk-1", ...}` (no `worker` field)

Request bodies accept either field name. Conflict resolution (Invariant 37
compliance -- silently dropping a field is forbidden):
- Both present and **equal**: accept (either field satisfies the request).
- Both present and **different**: return 400 with both values in the error
  body. Never silently pick a winner -- that is the exact dropped-field
  behavior Invariant 37 exists to forbid.

**CLI commands**: `amux session` and `amux worker` are both valid.
`amux issue` and `amux task` are both valid. Tab completion shows both.
The `--help` output uses the new terminology but notes the alias:
`amux worker (alias: session)`.

**Dashboard UI**: a pref (`terminology`: `"modern"` | `"legacy"`)
controls display labels. Default is `"modern"` (shows "Workers",
"Tasks"). Setting `"legacy"` shows "Sessions", "Issues". The toggle
is in Settings. Internal logic, data-testid attributes, and CSS
classes use the new names only; the pref only affects rendered text.

**SSE events**: `EventKind` variants use the new names internally
(`TaskCreated`, `WorkerStarted`). The SSE wire format includes a
`legacy_kind` field when `api_field_style != "modern"`:
`{"kind": "TaskCreated", "legacy_kind": "IssueCreated", ...}`.
Consumers filtering on the old string still match.

`legacy_kind` is generated from a single exhaustive mapping table
(`LEGACY_EVENT_NAMES: &[(EventKind, &str)]`), not from per-variant ad-hoc
strings. CI checks that every `EventKind` variant (except `Extension(_)`)
has exactly one entry in this table. An `EventKind` variant with no legacy
name is a CI failure, not a silent omission -- consumers would miss the
event entirely.

**Migration**: the Python -> Rust migration reads old field/table
names and writes new ones. No consumer-side migration is required
because aliases handle the translation at the API boundary.

**DB table names**: internal. The Rust schema uses `tasks` and
`workers`. This is invisible to API consumers and does not affect
backward compatibility.

**What is NOT aliased**: Rust type names (`Task`, `Worker`, `Session`,
`TaskId`, `WorkerId`), internal module paths, invariant IDs, and
RR item names use the new terminology only. These are not part of the
public contract.

The orchestrator's loop:

```rust
impl Orchestrator {
    async fn tick(&self, ctx: &AppContext) {
        // 1. Collect WorkerEvents from all active sessions
        let events = self.collect_events().await;

        // 2. Process events -> board transitions
        for event in events {
            match event {
                WorkerEvent::TurnCompleted(result) => {
                    self.evaluate_completion(result).await;
                }
                WorkerEvent::RateLimited(rl) => {
                    self.handle_rate_limit(rl).await;
                }
                WorkerEvent::Failed(f) => {
                    self.handle_failure(f).await;  // retry, decompose, or quarantine
                }
                // ...
            }
        }

        // 3. Find runnable work (dependency graph + capabilities + scope)
        let runnable = self.board.runnable_tasks().await;

        // 4. Match to available workers
        for task in runnable {
            if let Some(worker) = self.find_capable_worker(&task).await {
                self.assign(worker, task).await;
            }
        }

        // 5. Check lease expirations
        self.reclaim_expired_leases().await;
    }
}
```

### Worker capability matching

Pickup is not "find next TODO card." It is:

```rust
struct WorkerCapabilities {
    tools: HashSet<Tool>,
    repositories: HashSet<Repo>,
    browser: bool,
    filesystem: FsScope,
    integrations: HashSet<Integration>,
    provider: ProviderId,   // open string, not closed enum (Invariant 8)
}

struct WorkRequirements {
    capabilities: HashSet<Capability>,
}

fn is_capable(worker: &Worker, task: &Task) -> bool {
    // runnable (deps met)
    // AND group-visible (scope isolation)
    // AND worker has required capabilities
    // AND worker is available (not at WIP limit, not rate-limited)
}
```

### Context assembly pipeline

When a worker picks up a task, the orchestrator assembles its context:

```rust
trait ContextProvider: Send + Sync {
    async fn contribute(&self, req: &ContextRequest) -> Result<Vec<ContextFragment>>;
}

// Assembly order, with scope resolution at each layer:
// 1. Global instructions
// 2. Group instructions (override global)
// 3. Worker instructions (override group)
// 4. Task context (description, deps, related tasks)
// 5. Relevant memory (scoped: global, group, worker)
// 6. Environment / tool configuration (scoped)
// 7. Recent work / results from prior turns
// -> EffectiveContext (with token budget enforcement and provenance)
```

---

## Terminal backend evaluation

The terminal backend is the dominant complexity center in the Python system: ~90-100
tmux subprocess call sites, ~50 compiled regexes, 5 polling loops at
2s/3s/15s/60s/60s intervals, ~700 lines for rate-limit detection alone.

### What tmux costs today

1. **Character-level I/O**: `send-keys` injects text keystroke-by-keystroke. The 250-line
   `send_text` exists to fight autocomplete pickers, ghost text, Escape timing, and
   paste-buffer fallback.
2. **Scraping as control plane** (D1): 50+ regexes infer state from rendered terminal
   output. Breaks on any Claude Code UI string change.
3. **Polling overhead**: 5 loops, 40 subprocess calls per 60s cycle.
4. **Pane geometry fragility**: detached windows drift from 220x50.
5. **No structured lifecycle**: start is `new-session + send-keys`, stop is `send-keys /exit + hope`.

### Options evaluated

| Option | Description | Wins | Loses |
|---|---|---|---|
| **A: tmux improved** | tmux control-mode (`-CC`), persistent connection | Zero migration risk | 50 regexes stay, D1 stays |
| **B: herdr** | Process hosting, persistence, human terminal access | Session persistence, manual attach, recovery | No structured agent semantics on its own |
| **C: Native PTY** | Rust owns PTY via `portable-pty` | Zero subprocess overhead, streaming | Must solve persistence, lose manual attach |
| **D: OpenCode** | Structured agent protocol (commands, events, lifecycle) | IS the D1 exit, typed state | Depends on provider adoption |

### Recommendation

**Two layers: OpenCode for structured agent semantics + herdr for process hosting.**
tmux as fallback host. Native PTY as future option.

These are different concerns, not competing alternatives, and their boundaries
are strict:

- **OpenCode** provides the structured agent protocol -- typed commands, lifecycle
  events, state reporting. This is what eliminates terminal scraping as the control
  plane (the D1 exit). **All agent communication flows through OpenCode directly**:
  prompts, messages, cancellation, state queries, and events. The orchestrator
  talks to OpenCode, not to the backend, for anything involving agent semantics.

- **herdr** provides process hosting -- spawning, persisting, and providing human
  terminal access to agent sessions. It replaces tmux as the default process host
  because it is agent-oriented rather than terminal-oriented: cleaner lifecycle
  management, structured process state, no pane geometry drift. **herdr starts,
  stops, and lets humans inspect the OpenCode process. It does not carry prompts.**

The boundary: use herdr to start/stop/inspect the OpenCode process. Prompts,
messages, events, sessions, and cancellation go through OpenCode directly. This
eliminates most scraping entirely -- not by replacing `send-keys` with a
slightly better `send-keys`, but by removing the backend from the communication
path altogether.

Compared to the current tmux architecture:

- `send-keys` hacks are eliminated entirely (prompts go through OpenCode API)
- prompt delivery is typed and acknowledged (not fire-and-hope keystroke injection)
- state queries return structured data (not regex matches on rendered text)
- cancellation is a typed command (not Ctrl-C injection timing)

The structured agent semantics come from **OpenCode**, not from the process host:

- session/process lifecycle state (OpenCode reports, herdr hosts)
- waiting/blocked/completed detection (OpenCode structured events)
- turn boundaries and progress (OpenCode protocol)
- prompt/idle heuristics eliminated (OpenCode typed state)

The scraping goal is no longer "port all tmux scraping behavior to Rust." Instead:

1. OpenCode structured protocol is the sole communication channel
2. Provider hooks complement where available (Claude Code Stop/UserPromptSubmit)
3. Terminal output parsing is a fallback adapter for provider-specific signals
4. Scraping shrinks to liveness checks and rate-limit pattern detection only

tmux stays as a fallback process host behind the `SessionBackend` trait -- useful for
migration, debugging, and recovery. Native PTY (Option C) is a future target once
OpenCode + hooks cover enough that the scraper is liveness-only.

### SessionBackend trait (process lifecycle only)

The backend trait covers process hosting: start, stop, inspect. It does NOT
carry prompts, messages, or agent commands -- those go through OpenCode directly.
Higher layers never call herdr or tmux directly.

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait SessionBackend: Send + Sync {
    async fn spawn(&self, spec: SessionSpec) -> Result<ProcessRef>;
    async fn terminate(&self, session: &ProcessRef) -> Result<()>;
    async fn status(&self, session: &ProcessRef) -> Result<BackendStatus>;
    async fn attach_info(&self, session: &ProcessRef) -> Result<AttachInfo>;
    async fn reconcile(&self) -> Result<Vec<BackendSession>>;
}

enum BackendStatus {
    Running,
    Completed { exit_code: i32 },
    Crashed { signal: Option<i32> },
    NotFound,
}

struct AttachInfo {
    command: String,     // e.g. "herdr attach worker-name" or "tmux attach -t ..."
    pty_path: PathBuf,   // for human terminal access
}
```

`HerdrBackend` translates these to herdr's process hosting operations (spawn agent,
terminate, check liveness). `TmuxBackend` translates to `tmux new-session`,
`kill-session`, `has-session`, etc.

### OpenCode trait (agent communication)

All agent communication -- prompts, messages, cancellation, lifecycle queries --
goes through OpenCode directly, not through the backend.

```rust
#[async_trait]
trait AgentProtocol: Send + Sync {
    async fn send_prompt(&self, worker: &WorkerId, prompt: Prompt) -> Result<()>;
    async fn deliver_message(&self, worker: &WorkerId, msg: MessageId) -> Result<()>;
    async fn cancel(&self, worker: &WorkerId) -> Result<()>;
    async fn pause(&self, worker: &WorkerId) -> Result<()>;
    async fn resume(&self, worker: &WorkerId) -> Result<()>;
    async fn state(&self, worker: &WorkerId) -> Result<AgentState>;
    fn events(&self, worker: &WorkerId) -> impl Stream<Item = WorkerEvent>;
}

enum AgentState {
    Idle,
    Working { turn: TurnId, progress: Option<ProgressReport> },
    WaitingForInput,
    RateLimited(RateLimit),
    Paused,
    Exited(ExitStatus),
}
```

The orchestrator calls `AgentProtocol` for all worker interaction. It calls
`SessionBackend` only for process lifecycle (spawn on first assignment, terminate
on worker removal, reconcile on startup). This separation means:

- Switching backends (herdr -> tmux -> native PTY) changes nothing about how
  prompts, messages, or cancellation work
- OpenCode events stream regardless of which process host is running
- The backend never needs to understand prompt content or agent semantics
- `send-keys` hacks are eliminated entirely, not just reduced

### Key dependencies

| Concern | Crate | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| HTTP server | `axum` | async, tower middleware |
| Async runtime | `tokio` | multi-threaded, timers, process, signal |
| SQLite | `rusqlite` + `r2d2` | `bundled` feature, WAL mode, single-writer task |
| JSON | `serde` + `serde_json` | derive-based |
| SSE | `axum::response::sse` | built-in |
| TLS | `rustls` + `rcgen` | self-signed cert |
| Subprocess | `tokio::process` | herdr, tmux (fallback), git, node, browser-use |
| Embed files | `rust-embed` | dashboard baked into binary |
| CLI | `clap` | subcommand tree |
| Regex | `regex` | compiled pattern sets for terminal scraping |
| Tracing | `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber` | structured, correlation IDs |
| Web Push | `p256` + `hkdf` + `aes-gcm` | RFC 8291 |
| S3 | `aws-sdk-s3` | iCal feed |
| Gmail | `reqwest` | raw REST API |
| Cron | `cron` | schedule expression parsing |

### SQLite concurrency design

With 30+ jobs + HTTP + SSE + workers, SQLite needs explicit design:

- **WAL mode** always (concurrent readers, single writer)
- **Single writer task**: a dedicated `tokio::spawn` holds the write connection;
  mutations go through an `mpsc` channel. This prevents `SQLITE_BUSY` under Rust's
  real concurrency (Python's GIL accidentally serialized writes)
- **Busy timeout**: 5s for readers, writer never blocks (it IS the serialization point)
- **Connection pool**: `r2d2` for read-only connections (pool size = CPU cores)
- **Transaction boundaries**: one transaction per API request or orchestrator tick
- **Migration locking**: exclusive lock during schema migration, health endpoint
  returns 503 until complete
- **Backup**: periodic `.backup` to a second file; corruption recovery via PRAGMA
  integrity_check + restore from backup

---

## Migration strategy

### Phase 0: Foundation + golden scenario harness (est. 3 weeks)

**Goal**: binary that starts, serves the dashboard, manages the DB, AND the test
harness that will verify every subsequent phase.

1. **OpenCode provider spike** (week 1 -- gates everything else):
   - Connect to each of the four providers (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI,
     Ollama) via OpenCode's structured agent protocol.
   - For each provider, verify: session start, prompt delivery, event streaming
     (turn start/end, progress, tool use), rate-limit detection, graceful shutdown.
   - Record a coverage matrix:

     ```
     | Provider   | Start | Prompt | Events | Rate-limit | Shutdown | OpenCode |
     |------------|-------|--------|--------|------------|----------|----------|
     | Claude Code| ?     | ?      | ?      | ?          | ?        | ?        |
     | Gemini CLI | ?     | ?      | ?      | ?          | ?        | ?        |
     | Codex CLI  | ?     | ?      | ?      | ?          | ?        | ?        |
     | Ollama     | ?     | ?      | ?      | ?          | ?        | ?        |
     ```

   - **Written branch**: if OpenCode coverage < 3 of 4 providers for core lifecycle
     events (start, prompt, turn events), the terminal adapter (`TerminalAdapter`)
     promotes from scraping-fallback to peer of `OpenCodeAdapter`. The provider
     coverage matrix in Phase 4 gets rewritten to show which providers use which
     adapter, and the D1 exit condition changes from "scrapers demoted to liveness
     check" to "scrapers demoted for providers with OpenCode coverage, primary for
     providers without."
   - This spike determines the architecture's viability by week 1, not week 24.
   - **Gate**: the coverage matrix must be committed as `docs/provider-coverage.csv`
     (RR-0028e) before Phase 1 begins. The written-branch decision is a checklist
     item with its own RR ID so the agent cannot skip it.
   - **Re-estimate trigger**: if the written branch fires (OpenCode < 3/4 coverage),
     Phases 1 and 4 must be re-estimated before proceeding (RR-0028l), since
     promoting `TerminalAdapter` to a peer of `OpenCodeAdapter` changes scope in
     both phases. The 3-week Phase 0 estimate does not absorb this re-planning.
2. Scaffold workspace, crate structure
3. `amux-core`: Scope, Worker, Task, BoardTransition, WorkerCommand/Event,
   ProviderId, StateRevision, EntityType, Mutation -- all types, no I/O. This is the
   system's vocabulary. Every entity type carries a `version: u64` field.
4. `amux-server/db`: all tables as SQL migrations (count from schema discovery), WAL mode, single-writer task
5. `amux-server/config`: four-tier config loading (org/global/group/worker), `server.env`
6. `amux-server/api`: axum router, static file embedding, `/health`, auth,
   `/api/sync?since_rev=N` (Invariant 35), SSE with revisioned StateEvents
7. TLS setup with self-signed cert
8. **Golden scenario test harness** (Playwright-based): end-to-end scenario tests
   that will run against every phase. Start with:
   - Server starts, dashboard loads, health returns 200
   - Auth rejects bad token, accepts good token
9. **UI interaction coverage infrastructure** (Invariant 44):
   - `data-testid` on every interactive element from day one
   - Interaction contract registry (machine-readable component capabilities)
   - DOM inventory crawler: discovers all `data-testid` elements across
     reachable UI states, diffs against registry, fails on uncovered controls
   - Fault injection hooks (`#[cfg(test)]` only)
10. **UX discovery harness** (Invariant 46):
   - Automated UX interaction graph crawler (BFS, semantic state hashing)
   - Interactive control detection (buttons, links, inputs, roles, draggable, etc.)
   - Seed state fixtures (empty, populated, migrated, per-worker-state, per-task-state)
   - Crawler self-test (fixture pages with intentionally hidden/nested controls)
   - Generated artifacts: `interaction-graph.json`, `interaction-coverage.json`

### Phase 1: Workers + Orchestrator (est. 3 weeks)

**Goal**: create workers, start/stop them, orchestrator assigns work.

1. `amux-core/worker`: Worker struct, WorkerConfig, WorkerCapabilities
2. `amux-core/orchestrator`: Orchestrator trait, WorkAssignment, Lease
3. `amux-server/opencode/`: AgentProtocol impl -- direct communication with
   agents (prompts, messages, cancel, state queries, event stream). All agent
   interaction flows here, never through the backend.
4. `amux-server/backend/herdr.rs`: SessionBackend impl for herdr -- process
   lifecycle only (spawn, terminate, inspect, reconcile)
5. `amux-server/backend/tmux.rs`: SessionBackend impl for tmux -- process
   lifecycle only (fallback)
6. `amux-server/backend/adapter.rs`: terminal output -> WorkerEvent fallback
   translator (ANSI stripping, provider-specific rate-limit regexes). Used only
   for signals OpenCode/hooks do not expose structurally.
7. `amux-server/api/workers.rs`: CRUD, start (202 async), stop, peek, send
7. `amux-server/orchestrator`: runtime loop, startup reconciliation
8. SSE: worker state stream

The orchestrator runs from day one, even if its initial behavior is simple (pick up
next TODO, assign to idle worker). It grows in sophistication over phases.

**Test plan (per provider -- Claude, Gemini, Codex, Ollama)**:
- Unit: ANSI stripper handles test corpus

- proptest: no double-lease for arbitrary event sequences (Invariant 22)
- proptest: verified implies done occurred previously (Invariant 22)
- proptest: no duplicate delivery for same idempotency key (Invariant 34)
- proptest: command queue FIFO preserved under arbitrary enqueue/dequeue (Invariant 34)

  preserved, old session terminated after new session healthy (Invariant 43)

  no session restart (Invariant 43)

  (Invariant 43)

- Playwright: message thread on task detail -- send, reply, unread indicator (Invariant 29)

### Phase 2: Board + dependency graph (est. 3 weeks)

**Goal**: full board with gates, graph, scoped configuration, atomic claiming.

1. `amux-core/board`: Task, TaskRelation, dependency graph, gate derivation
2. `amux-core/board/state_machine`: apply_transition with scope-aware gates
3. `amux-server/api/board.rs`: all routes, 409 gate contract, force+audit
4. Board auto-capture (prompt -> task, derived title, no helper-model call)
5. Orchestrator integration: `board.runnable_tasks()` uses dependency graph +
   capabilities + scope
6. Scoped gates: global gates, group overrides, worker specialization

**Test plan**:
- Unit: gate derivation for each (item_type, scope) combination
- Unit: global gate applies when group has no override
- Unit: group gate overrides global gate for same column transition
- Unit: worker-level gate overrides group gate
- Unit: gate inheritance chain: global defines 3 gates, group removes 1, worker adds 1
  -> effective gates are correct
- Unit: column definitions scoped to group (group A has 5 columns, group B has 3)
- Unit: dependency graph: A blocks C, B blocks C, both complete -> C runnable
- Unit: dependency graph: circular dependency detected and rejected at create time
- Unit: atomic claim: two concurrent claims, exactly one succeeds (sqlx test with
  two connections)
- Unit: lease expires -> task reclaimable, original worker's claim is void
- Unit: `force=true` bypasses gate, writes audit trail including actor + reason
- Unit: `Gate` entity CRUD -- create, scope, version, history (Invariant 18)
- Unit: `why-blocked` query returns gate id, criterion, missing evidence, suggested
  command (Invariant 18)
- Unit: VerifierKind ordering: deterministic before ModelJudgment (Invariant 28)
- Unit: task state vs execution state separation -- rate-limit changes execution
  state only, never board state (Invariant 19)
- Unit: priority scoring: critical-path weight + explicit priority + age starvation +
  affinity + provider availability + cost (Invariant 25)
- proptest: dependency graph is acyclic for arbitrary relation insertions (rejects cycles)
- proptest: force bypass always produces audit entry with actor (Invariant 22)
- proptest: `TaskRelation::Blocks` and `TaskRelation::DependsOn` are inverse-consistent
- Simulation: 100 tasks with complex dependency graph, orchestrator resolves runnable
  set in topological order (Invariant 22)
- Integration: create parent + children, complete children, parent becomes runnable
- Integration: board CRUD through full lifecycle (todo->claimed->doing->review->done
  ->verified) with proper gate acks at each transition
- Integration: group A board has custom columns, group B has default columns, both
  work independently
- Integration: API responses match OpenAPI contract for every board endpoint
- Integration: `DurableEvent` emitted for every board transition (Invariant 24)
- Integration: `why-blocked` API returns actionable gate info (Invariant 18)
- Playwright: board renders, drag-and-drop transitions work, gate 409 shown as toast
  with the exact gate criteria and CLI command to satisfy
- Playwright: mobile board usable at 375px, touch targets >= 44px
- Playwright: user creates task in group A, worker in group B cannot see it
- Playwright: no-stall check -- complete a task, verify worker picks up next or
  goes idle with all tasks terminal
- Playwright: `why-blocked` detail panel shows criteria, evidence, suggested CLI (Invariant 18)

### Phase 3: Scheduling (est. 2 weeks)

**Goal**: user-facing durable schedules + internal periodic tasks, kept separate.

User schedules (durable):
- Persist in DB with run history, missed-run behavior, timezone semantics, retry policy
- Scoped to global/group/worker
- Audit trail (X-Amux-Session attribution on every mutation)

Internal periodic tasks (ephemeral):
- In-memory, no run history needed
- `tokio::time::interval`, not threads with `time.sleep`
- A slow task doesn't block others (spawned as separate tokio tasks)

```rust
// These are different things with different semantics
struct DurableSchedule { /* DB-backed, history, retry */ }
struct PeriodicTask { /* in-memory, interval, fire-and-forget */ }
```

**Test plan**:
- Unit: cron expression parser handles all formats (daily, every Nm, weekday, 5-field)
- Unit: schedule CRUD respects audit trail
- Unit: missed-run behavior (skip vs. catch-up)
- Unit: `DurableSchedule` vs `PeriodicTask` are separate types with separate lifecycles
- Unit: schedule scoped to group only fires for workers in that group (Invariant 2)
- Integration: create schedule, run-now, verify `schedule_runs` with `source` field
- Integration: periodic task ticks at interval, does not block other tasks
- Integration: `DurableEvent` emitted for schedule fire, manual run, missed run (Invariant 24)
- Playwright: schedule list, create, edit, run-now button works

### Phase 4: Control plane (steering, rate-limit, auto-responder) (est. 2 weeks)

**Goal**: WorkerCommand delivery, WorkerEvent processing, message delivery, and
compaction subsystem.

1. Command queue: DB-backed per-worker queue with delivery protocol (Invariant 34)
2. WorkerCommand dispatch through AgentProtocol (OpenCode) with delivery confirmation
3. OpenCode -> WorkerEvent translation (structured lifecycle), terminal adapter as
   fallback for provider-specific rate-limit detection
4. Scan demotion: hook-reported workers get demoted capture frequency
5. Auto-responder for `--dangerously-skip-permissions` workers
6. Turn tracking: TurnStarted/TurnCompleted events drive the orchestrator
7. Message delivery: `Message` entities delivered at turn boundaries (Invariant 29)
8. Dead-letter handling: commands that exhaust retries produce StallViolation (Invariant 34)
9. Compaction subsystem: context 70% -> prepare, 85% -> compact, 95% -> checkpoint +
   new session, new session -> hydrate from compacted context (Invariant 31)

**Test plan**:
- Unit: steering dedup prevents double delivery
- Unit: rate-limit regexes match all known formats per provider (14 patterns for Claude,
  2 for Gemini, 1 for Codex, 1 for Ollama)
- Unit: scan demotion correctly classifies hook-reported vs. hookless
- Unit: WorkerEvent translation from all known terminal states
- Unit: backpressure -- command queue per worker bounded at 16, rejects with 429 (Invariant 26)
- Unit: backpressure -- SSE channel drops oldest + sends reconnect hint on overflow (Invariant 26)
- Unit: `ContextSnapshot` created on every assignment, hash stable for identical content (Invariant 27)
- Unit: context assembly priority: task > deps > memory > turns > history (Invariant 16)
- Simulation: 10 workers rate-limiting simultaneously, orchestrator redistributes
  to available providers within 3 ticks (Invariant 20/22)
- Simulation: command delivery under backpressure -- no lost commands, 429 for overflow (Invariant 26)
- Simulation: server restart with 5 pending commands -- all redelivered via
  idempotency, no duplicates (Invariant 34)
- Simulation: command with precondition -- entity changes before delivery,
  command expires with PreconditionResult::Failed (Invariant 38)
- Simulation: human message has no precondition, always delivers (Invariant 38)
- Simulation: command dispatch fails 2x then succeeds -- retry backoff, final
  Confirmed state (Invariant 34)
- Simulation: command exhausts 3 retries -- dead-lettered, StallViolation emitted,
  dashboard alert (Invariant 34)
- Simulation: 40 workers, mixed DeliveryTiming -- Immediate commands bypass turn
  boundary, AtTurnBoundary commands wait, WhenIdle commands queue (Invariant 34)
- Integration: enqueue command, verify delivery within 4s
- Integration: command survives server restart -- pending command redelivered (Invariant 34)
- Integration: dead-letter visible via `GET /api/workers/:id/dead-letters` (Invariant 34)
- Integration: queue depth reflected in worker health, deep queue warns (Invariant 34)
- Integration: rate-limit auto-wait fires on simulated terminal output
- Integration: `IntegrationState` transitions reflected in `/health` endpoint (Invariant 23)
- Integration: Gmail unavailable -> email operations queue, recover on reconnect (Invariant 23)
- Integration: message delivered at turn boundary, not mid-turn (Invariant 29)
- Integration: offline message queued, delivered on reconnect (Invariant 29)
- Integration: compaction at 85% context -- compacted fragment created, source turns
  preserved, token_after < token_before (Invariant 31)
- Integration: MemoryEntry CRUD -- scope isolation, version increments, soft delete (Invariant 42)
- Integration: MEMORY.md generated from MemoryEntry table, read-only (Invariant 39/42)
- Integration: compacted summary references source entries by ID, never overwrites (Invariant 39)
- Integration: concurrent memory writes to same entry -> 409 conflict (Invariant 42)
- Incident regression: incident_2026_07_30_duplicate_draft (Invariant 41)
- Incident regression: incident_2026_07_30_board_read_after_write (Invariant 41)
- Incident regression: incident_2026_08_xx_stale_steering (Invariant 38/41)
- Integration: context 95% triggers checkpoint + new session, new session hydrates
  from compacted context (Invariant 31)
- Integration: compaction never deletes source turns/messages/logs (Invariant 31)
- Simulation: context exhaustion cycle: 10 turns -> compact -> 10 more turns -> new
  session -> hydrate -> continue (Invariant 31)
- Playwright: worker status updates live in dashboard, rate-limit shown within 2s
- Playwright: provider quota dashboard shows fleet-level capacity (Invariant 20)
- Playwright: compaction indicator on worker card when context > 70% (Invariant 31)
- Playwright: dead-letter badge on worker card when commands fail delivery (Invariant 34)
- Playwright: queue health warning when delivery rate < 90% (Invariant 34)

### Phase 5: Verification (est. 2 weeks)

**Goal**: verification as a first-class lifecycle stage, not a manual flag.

1. `Verification` struct with criteria, evidence, result
2. Verification pipeline: done -> verification execution -> verified or rejected
3. Playwright-based acceptance tests for every user-facing flow
4. Integration with CI: `verified` requires green pipeline + prod confirmation

The user flow acceptance tests built here become the regression suite:

- User submits work to a worker via the dashboard
- Work gets decomposed into tasks on the board
- Tasks get picked up by workers (orchestrator assigns)
- Tasks flow through board statuses with gate acknowledgments
- Completed tasks go through verification
- Failed verification returns to in-progress
- Successful verification closes the task

**Test plan**:
- Unit: verification state machine (done->verification->verified|rejected->in_progress)
- Unit: cheapest-verifier-first ordering: Command < HttpCheck < FileExists <
  PlaywrightAssertion < ModelJudgment (Invariant 28)
- Unit: free verifier failure short-circuits -- model verifier never called (Invariant 28)
- Simulation: verification pipeline with mixed verifier types, cost-ordered execution
- Integration: task completes, verification runs, evidence recorded
- Integration: verification fails, task returns to doing with rejection reason
- Integration: `DurableEvent::VerificationStarted` and `VerificationFailed`/`TaskVerified`
  emitted with full evidence chain (Invariant 24)
- Integration: task detail API returns all correlated views: activity, messages, worker
  output, tool calls, transitions, gate evaluations, verification evidence (Invariant 30)
- Integration: clicking a gate evaluation traces to the tool call, turn, and worker
  output that produced the evidence (Invariant 30)

**Playwright golden scenarios (the acceptance criteria)**:

Each scenario runs end-to-end in a real browser using herdr as the default backend.
Timing is measured and asserted. At least one complete scenario (the happy path)
executes identically with `AMUX_BACKEND=herdr` and `AMUX_BACKEND=tmux`, producing
the same board transitions, WorkerEvents, verification result, and final task state
(Invariant 33).

1. **Happy path (per provider: Claude, Gemini, Codex, Ollama)**:
   - User opens dashboard, submits work text to a worker via the UI
   - Work gets decomposed into tasks on the board (< 5s)
   - Orchestrator assigns task to worker (< 3s)
   - Worker picks up, starts executing (status shows "active" within 2s)
   - Worker completes, task moves to "done" (status shows "idle" within 2s)
   - Verification runs (Playwright checks the work, evidence recorded)
   - Task moves to "verified" -- terminal state
   - **Assert**: no stalls at any point. Worker status was never stale > 2s.

2. **Failure + retry**:
   - Worker fails a task (verification rejects)
   - Task returns to "doing" with rejection reason visible in UI
   - Worker retries, succeeds
   - Task reaches "verified"
   - **Assert**: rejection reason displayed as toast and in task detail

3. **Rate limit recovery (per provider)**:
   - Worker hits rate limit during work
   - Dashboard shows "rate limited" status within 2s (not stale "active")
   - Reset time displayed in UI
   - Worker auto-resumes after reset
   - Task continues to completion
   - **Assert**: no manual intervention required

4. **Dependency chain**:
   - Create parent with 3 children
   - Children assigned to workers, run concurrently
   - As each child completes, parent remains blocked
   - All children done -> parent becomes runnable -> assigned -> completed -> verified
   - **Assert**: dependency graph respected, no premature pickup

5. **Scoped gates**:
   - Group A requires code review gate, Group B does not
   - Worker in Group A completes task -> blocked at review gate
   - Worker in Group B completes task -> moves straight to done
   - **Assert**: gate enforcement matches group scope

6. **Offline mode**:
   - Dashboard goes offline (network disconnect)
   - User creates 3 board cards, sends 2 worker commands
   - Dashboard reconnects
   - All 5 queued operations replay successfully
   - **Assert**: all operations applied, no duplicates, conflicts shown as toasts

7. **No-stall invariant**:
   - Create 5 tasks, start 2 workers
   - Workers process tasks
   - At every 5s checkpoint: no worker is idle with non-terminal tasks in its scope
   - All tasks reach terminal state
   - **Assert**: zero stall violations across entire run

8. **Multi-provider fleet**:
   - Start 1 Claude worker, 1 Gemini worker, 1 Ollama worker
   - Assign different tasks to each
   - All three complete independently
   - **Assert**: each provider's status updates are timely, no cross-provider confusion

9. **Backend interchangeability (Invariant 33)**:
   - Run the happy path with `AMUX_BACKEND=herdr` (default)
   - Run the identical happy path with `AMUX_BACKEND=tmux`
   - **Assert**: same board transitions, same WorkerEvents, same verification result,
     same final task state. The backend is invisible above the `SessionBackend` trait.

10. **Real-time convergence (Invariant 35)**:
    - Open two browser tabs
    - Tab 1: create 10 board cards rapidly
    - Intercept SSE: drop every 3rd event to Tab 2
    - Tab 2 detects rev gap, delta syncs
    - Both tabs show identical state
    - Kill server, restart
    - Both tabs reconnect, delta sync from their last rev
    - Mutate same task from both tabs simultaneously
    - Loser gets 409, reconciles
    - **Assert**: both tabs converge to identical, revision-consistent state.
      No stale, duplicate, or missing entities at any point after convergence.

### Phase 6: Email, Calendar (est. 2 weeks)

**Goal**: integration subsystems, each scoped.

1. Email: Gmail OAuth2 via `reqwest`, send/reply/inbox/search. Scoped to worker.
2. Calendar: events CRUD, iCal generation (RFC 5545), S3 upload. Scoped to global.

CRM is intentionally deprecated in the Rust rebuild.

**Test plan**:
- Unit: iCal RFC 5545 (line folding, UTC, VALUE=DATE)
- Integration: Gmail OAuth token refresh (mock HTTP)
- Integration: S3 upload (LocalStack or mock)
- Playwright: email compose, calendar event creation

### Phase 7: Browser profiles, files, misc (est. 2 weeks)

**Goal**: remaining subsystems.

1. Browser profiles: native Chrome profile management (no Python browser-use dep),
   CDP-direct screenshot/navigation, profile inventory with saved-auth tracking,
   lock-file cleanup on startup, and a clean split between profile management (always
   free) and AI-driven browsing (model call only when needed)
2. Files: browse, upload, download, ebook reader
3. Push notifications: VAPID + RFC 8291
4. Graph, journal, proxy, torrent, alerts, metrics

**Test plan**:
- Unit: Web Push encryption roundtrip
- Unit: VAPID JWT generation
- Integration: browser profile create -> start -> screenshot -> stop lifecycle
- Integration: profile lock-file cleanup on server restart
- Integration: CDP screenshot matches expected dimensions
- Integration: file upload/download roundtrip
- Integration: push subscription lifecycle
- Playwright: browser tab shows profile inventory with auth domains
- Playwright: start profile, navigate, screenshot renders in dashboard
- Playwright: file browser navigable

### Phase 8: Dashboard + CLI (est. 4 weeks — re-estimated)

**Goal**: extract SPA, build CLI binary, full interaction coverage infrastructure.

**This phase is a rewrite, not an extraction.** The dashboard is normalized to
EntityStore, revision-ordered application, 487+ instrumented controls, offline-first
client state, and the full UX discovery harness. The est. 2 weeks was from before
the UI interaction coverage (Invariant 44) and UX discovery (Invariant 46)
requirements. Realistic estimate: 4 weeks.

**Strangler-fig interaction**: before this phase, Playwright tests run against the
Python dashboard proxied through Rust. Those tests prove API behavior and data flow,
not Rust dashboard rendering. From Phase 8 onward, Playwright tests run against the
native Rust-served dashboard. Phase 8 is the transition point — all Playwright tests
must pass on both the proxied and native dashboard before the proxy is removed.

1. Extract 44k-line inline SPA into `amux-dashboard/static/`
2. `rust-embed` for compile-time inclusion
3. Version stamping via `build.rs`
4. CLI: `clap` subcommand tree mirroring the bash script
5. Terminology aliases: `session`/`worker` and `issue`/`task` coexist (Invariant 53).
   New terminology is the default; old terminology works via route aliases,
   response field aliasing (pref-controlled), and CLI command aliases.
6. `data-testid` on every interactive element (Invariant 44)
7. Interaction contract registry for all components
8. DOM inventory crawler + CI coverage gate
9. **UX discovery: full application graph** (Invariant 46):
   - Run discovery against complete dashboard with all seed states
   - Desktop + mobile separate graphs
   - Offline graph + reconnection paths
   - Fault-state edges (success/409/500/timeout/offline per mutation)
   - Deep nested path verification
   - Generated Playwright test suite from stable discovered paths
   - Reconcile discovered graph with RR checklist
   - Commit UX baseline to `tests/ux/contract.json`

**Test plan**:
- Integration: served dashboard matches extracted source
- Integration: service worker caches shell URLs
- Integration: `amux board add "test"` creates card, prints ID
- Integration: `amux send <worker> "hello"` delivers
- Playwright: all dashboard tabs render, PWA offline works
- Playwright: SSE delivers revisioned StateEvents, client applies in rev order (Invariant 35)
- Playwright: rev gap triggers delta sync (drop SSE events, verify convergence) (Invariant 35)
- Playwright: two tabs mutate same task -> both converge (Invariant 35)
- Playwright: kill server, restart -> client reconnects and delta-syncs (Invariant 35)
- Playwright: 1,000 rapid board mutations -> UI finishes at exact backend rev (Invariant 35)
- Playwright: connection indicator shows LIVE/STALE/OFFLINE/SYNCING (Invariant 35)
- Playwright: optimistic write rejected (409) -> rollback visible to user (Invariant 35)
- Playwright: **interaction coverage audit** -- DOM crawl discovers all interactive
  controls, diffs against registry, 100% coverage required (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: board card full nested path -- open menu -> Move -> column picker ->
  gate modal -> ack -> loading -> server accepts -> modal closes -> card moves ->
  toast -> SSE reconciliation -> card stays (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: board drag/drop as transaction -- pointerDown -> pointerMove -> drop ->
  optimistic move -> API -> revision -> card location matches backend (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: board drag/drop failure -- drop -> 409 gate -> card returns to original
  column -> gate toast -> no phantom local move (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: double-click on every mutation button -> no duplicate mutation (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: keyboard navigation -- Enter/Space on all [role=button] (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: text entry -- empty + long + Unicode on all text inputs (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: loading states -- every mutation disables control and shows spinner (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: server 500 on mutation -> error shown, local state sane (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: fault injection -- sse_drop_every=5, verify convergence (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: fault injection -- latency_ms=1500, verify loading states (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: fault injection -- server restart mid-modal, verify recovery (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: touch targets >= 44px on mobile viewport (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: geometry assertion -- important containers have height > 0 (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: browser back/forward restores state correctly (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: tab sleep 10min -> wake -> delta sync -> UI current (Invariant 44)
- Playwright: model-based test -- IssueModal state machine, no impossible states
  reachable via generated action sequences (Invariant 44)
- **CI gate**: new data-testid without registered interaction contract -> build fails

### Phase 9: Observability + performance (est. 2 weeks)

**Goal**: correlation-ID tracing and performance baselines.

Every operation is traceable: task -> assignment -> worker -> turn ->
command -> tool -> outcome. Correlation IDs flow through the entire stack.

```
Task #421
└─ assigned worker-3
   └─ session s-8821
      └─ turn t-4
         └─ blocked waiting on #419
            └─ #419 verification failed: test X
```

Generalized `why` query -- not just "why is this stuck" but "why did this happen":

```
amux why task AR-42       # full provenance chain
amux why worker backend    # current state + how it got there
amux why command CMD-83    # dispatch path, precondition result, delivery
amux why schedule SCHED-108 # last N fires, source (cron/manual), outcomes
amux why integration gmail  # auth state, last success/failure, degradation
```

All answered from structured provenance (Invariant 24), not grep over logs.

Performance measurement:
- Dashboard load time (target: <500ms cold, <100ms cached)
- SSE event latency (target: <2s from state change to client)
- Worker start time (target: <3s from button press to running)
- API response time p50/p95/p99 for all routes
- Memory usage (target: <200MB RSS with 40 workers idle)
- CPU usage (target: <5% at idle with 40 workers)

**Test plan**:
- Integration: correlation IDs present in all log entries for a traced operation
- Integration: dashboard "why is this stuck?" query returns full trace
- Integration: `GET /api/search?q=...` returns hits across tasks, messages, events,
  logs, workers, schedules, email (Invariant 32)
- Integration: search result provenance -- every `SearchHit` carries entity_type,
  scope, task_id, worker_id, timestamp (Invariant 32)
- Integration: FTS5 search works completely offline (Invariant 32)
- Integration: exact/filter lookup -> SQLite index -> FTS5 -> optional semantic
  reranking stack (Invariant 32)
- Integration: structured events vs logs -- same task, both views present, correlated
  by turn_id (Invariant 30)
- Playwright: universal search bar -- type query, results span all entity types with
  provenance chips (Invariant 32)
- Playwright: search result click navigates to entity detail with context (Invariant 32)
- Performance: FTS5 search over 10k entities returns < 50ms (Invariant 32)
- Performance: all latency targets met under load (40 workers, 100 board items)
- Performance: RSS stays flat over 24h soak test
- Performance: no file descriptor leaks over 24h

### Phase 10: CI/CD pipeline (est. 1 week)

**Goal**: zero-regression guarantee with tiered CI gates. The acceptance suite that
proves the rebuild becomes the permanent regression suite that protects it (see
§Acceptance suite vs permanent regression suite).

**Tiered pipeline** (see §CI tiers for full definitions):

1. **PR Fast Gate** (every PR, < 10 min): cargo check + clippy, unit tests,
   simulations, property tests (bounded), API contract, MockBackend/MockProvider
   conformance, migration/schema compat, targeted Playwright smoke, static
   interaction-coverage validation, fast historical regressions. No merge if red.

2. **PR Full Gate** (merge candidates): all unit + integration, Herdr + tmux
   conformance, all 4 provider adapters, full API/CLI/browser suites (desktop +
   mobile), offline/reconnect, SSE/revision/fault-injection, config mutation,
   historical regression corpus (full), migrated-data + net-new fixtures. No
   deployment if red.

3. **Nightly deep gate**: multi-provider golden scenarios, 40+ Herdr workers, extended
   simulation/fuzz, migration against sanitized prod snapshot, browser matrix,
   performance benchmarks, resource leak tests, fault-injection matrix.

4. **Release gate**: Full Gate green + migration dry-run + real Herdr scenario +
   offline + UI coverage + production smoke.

5. **Periodic soak gate** (weekly): 24h soak, lifecycle churn, session replacement,
   rate-limit cycling, DB growth/compaction, SSE reconnect, FD/RSS leak detection.

**Spec-to-test traceability** (CI-enforced):
- Every `RR-XXXX` maps to at least one test (or is marked documentation-only)
- Every `VERIFIED` item's tests exist and pass
- Test deletion/rename without updating the requirement fails CI
- New user-facing capability without acceptance test fails CI

**Regression detection thresholds**:
- Latency regression: any p95 increase >10% vs baseline is a CI failure
- Memory regression: RSS increase >20% vs baseline is a CI failure
- Feature regression: any Playwright scenario that was green and turns red blocks merge
- Interaction coverage regression: any interactive control without a test blocks merge
- Binary size regression: growth >20% blocks merge

**Migrated-data regression fixture**: sanitized representative fixture from the
real Python AMUX dataset. Permanent -- future schema changes must load it
successfully and preserve its semantics.

### Phase 11: Migration + go-live (est. 2 weeks)

**Goal**: zero-downtime cutover from Python to Rust with full data migration.

#### Data migration

SQLite schema is preserved, so the DB file is directly compatible. But:

1. **Schema diff**: run both servers' migration code against the same DB, diff the
   resulting schemas. Any mismatch blocks go-live.
2. **Data validation**: for every table, verify row counts match and spot-check
   content (especially `tasks`, `schedules`, `prefs`, `email_events`).
3. **Worker config migration**: `.env` files -> validated `WorkerConfig` structs.
   Any validation failure produces a report, not a silent skip.

#### Cutover sequence: strangler-fig (continuous, not six-month shadow)

Rust goes on port 8822 from Phase 1 -- not Phase 11. It serves migrated route
groups natively and proxies the rest to Python on 8823. Cutover is continuous:
each phase migrates more routes to native Rust, shrinking the proxy surface.
Rollback is per-route (revert to proxying), not all-or-nothing.

```
Phase 1:  /health, /api/workers (+/api/sessions alias)  → native Rust
          everything else                               → proxy to Python:8823
Phase 2:  + /api/board, /api/tasks (+/api/issues alias) → native Rust
Phase 3:  + /api/schedules                       → native Rust
Phase 4:  + /api/sessions/*/send, steering       → native Rust
Phase 5:  + /api/board/*/status-request, verify  → native Rust
Phase 6:  + /api/email, /api/cal-events → native Rust
Phase 7:  + /api/browser, /api/files             → native Rust
Phase 8:  + / (dashboard), /api/sync, SSE        → native Rust
Phase 9:  + /api/debug, /api/metrics             → native Rust
Phase 10: remove proxy entirely -- Python stops
```

Benefits over shadow mode:
- The agent gets production signal on its own architecture by week 8, not week 24.
- Each migrated route is immediately validated under real traffic.
- A bug in the Rust board handler doesn't block email or scheduling.
- Week-2 architectural decisions are validated in production, not deferred to a
  single big-bang in week 24.

The proxy is a simple HTTP reverse proxy in the Rust binary: unmigrated routes
forward to `http://localhost:8823` with headers preserved. It is the first thing
deleted, not a permanent abstraction.

#### Backend migration

The Rust rebuild migrates toward herdr as the primary backend:

- herdr is the default for new workers (`backend: "herdr"`)
- Existing tmux-based workers continue on tmux during migration
- Workers can be individually switched between herdr and tmux via config
  (`backend: "tmux"` override)
- Backend choice does not require DB/schema changes
- Backend choice does not change worker identity or task ownership
- A worker can restart on a different backend while preserving all durable
  amux state (Invariant 33)

tmux remains available as rollback/fallback throughout, not as a parallel
control plane. There is one orchestrator, one WorkerCommand protocol, one
WorkerEvent protocol, one worker state machine, and one reconciliation system.
herdr and tmux only translate those primitives to/from their underlying
process-host mechanisms.

#### Rollback plan

At any point during shadow or swap:
1. Stop Rust server
2. Start Python server on 8822
3. DB is compatible in both directions (no destructive migrations)

Backend rollback: switch any worker from herdr back to tmux by changing its
`backend` config and restarting. No data migration, no identity change.

#### Cloud deployment

1. Update `deploy-cloud.yml` to build Rust Docker image
2. Rust binary built with `--target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` for Alpine containers
3. Same single-codebase rule: one binary, no cloud/local branching

## Estimated timeline

| Phase | Duration | Running total |
|---|---|---|
| 0 - Foundation + test harness + OpenCode spike | 3 weeks | 3 weeks |
| 1 - Workers + Orchestrator (Rust on 8822, proxy to Python) | 3 weeks | 6 weeks |
| 2 - Board + dependency graph | 3 weeks | 9 weeks |
| 3 - Scheduling | 2 weeks | 11 weeks |
| 4 - Control plane | 2 weeks | 13 weeks |
| 5 - Verification | 2 weeks | 15 weeks |
| 6 - Email/Calendar | 2 weeks | 17 weeks |
| 7 - Browser/files/misc | 2 weeks | 19 weeks |
| 8 - Dashboard + CLI (rewrite, not extraction) | 4 weeks | 23 weeks |
| 9 - Observability + performance | 2 weeks | 25 weeks |
| 10 - CI/CD pipeline | 1 week | 26 weeks |
| 11 - Migration + go-live (proxy removed, Python stops) | 2 weeks | **28 weeks** |

~7 months. Phase 8 re-estimated from 2 to 4 weeks to account for the normalized
EntityStore, 487+ instrumented controls, UX discovery harness, and the Playwright
transition from proxied to native dashboard. Phases 0-5 (the core) take 15 weeks.
The strangler-fig model means Rust serves production traffic from Phase 1 --
architectural decisions are validated continuously, not in a single shadow-mode
week at the end. Phases 6-7 are the integration long tail (parallelizable, saves
~2 weeks). Phase 11 is cleanup: remove the proxy, stop Python, finalize migration.

## Risks

1. **Dashboard compatibility**: 44k lines of JS talking to 212 API routes. Any response
   shape mismatch breaks the UI. Mitigation: `serde` structs match Python's exact
   response shapes; Playwright catches regressions.
2. **Feature velocity**: amux gains ~2-3 features/week in Python. During the rewrite,
   development must continue. Mitigation: Python stays the dev target until phase 11
   swap; the golden scenario harness catches drift.
3. **Terminal scraping residue**: provider-specific rate-limit regexes must still be
   ported for signals OpenCode/hooks cannot expose structurally. Mitigation: OpenCode's
   structured agent protocol handles most lifecycle transitions directly; scraping
   scope is reduced to provider-specific rate-limit patterns only. Extract test corpus
   from Python, run as unit tests per provider.
4. **SQLite under real concurrency**: Python's GIL accidentally serialized writes. Rust
   exposes latent races. Mitigation: single-writer task, WAL mode, explicit transaction
   boundaries designed in phase 0.
5. **Scope resolution complexity**: four-tier inheritance with overrides is easy to
   spec, hard to get right in every query. Mitigation: one resolver function in
   `amux-core`, used by all consumers. Never re-derive scope logic per-query.

## Doc enforceability

### Semantic invariant IDs

Every invariant has a stable semantic ID (`INV-xxx`) in addition to its number.
The semantic ID is:
- Tagged in code: `// INV-BOARD-SOT` in the implementation
- Tagged in tests: `#[test] fn inv_board_sot_...`
- CI-enforced bidirectionally:
  1. No invariant in this document without at least one test tagged with its ID
  2. No `INV-xxx` tag in code/tests without a matching invariant in this document

| 51 | `INV-DECOMP-CAP` | Decomposition depth cap |
| 52 | `INV-CAPABILITY-POLICY` | Capability policy |
| 53 | `INV-TERMINOLOGY-COMPAT` | Terminology is opt-in and backward-compatible |

The numbering is non-sequential (1-21, 33-41, 22-32, 42-53) because invariants
were added over time. The semantic IDs are the stable identifiers; numbers are
retained for backward compatibility with existing cross-references but are not
the canonical reference. New invariants get the next number AND a semantic ID.

### Doc sunset plan

Every section of this document has a planned destination at cutover. Sections
that survive as prose are stale by definition -- the implementation is the
source of truth after cutover.

| Section | Destination | When |
|---------|-------------|------|
| Invariant definitions (types, enums, structs) | Rust doc comments + proptest properties | Phase 0 |
| Test plans per phase | Test files with `INV-xxx` tags | Each phase |
| Migration manifest | Machine-readable JSON/TOML + migration code | Phase 11 |
| Policy defaults table | `capability-policy.toml` | Phase 0 |
| Execution checklist (RR items) | CI traceability infra (RR -> test mapping) | Phase 10 |
| Lessons from Python (L1-L6) | ADR files in `docs/adr/` | Phase 0 |
| Timeline / estimates | Project tracker (board tasks with deadlines) | Phase 0 |
| Provider coverage matrix | Generated from test suite tags | Phase 1 |
| ADR-001 (SQLite) | `docs/adr/001-sqlite-per-tenant.md` | Phase 0 |
| This sunset table | Deleted at cutover | Phase 11 |

At cutover, this document reduces to: the ethos (immutable), the semantic ID
table (index only), and the ADR index. Everything else has migrated to code,
tests, or ADR files. If a section still contains load-bearing information at
cutover, that is a bug -- the information should have been expressed in code.

### Doc-code reconciliation (Invariant 45 extension)

Invariant 45 says reopen stale `VERIFIED` markers if tests fail. This extends
to the document itself: if the implementation diverges from a stated invariant,
the agent must either fix the code OR propose an amendment. Silent disagreement
between doc and code is the failure mode this rule exists to prevent.

#### Normative clause protection

The invariant list and each invariant's **normative clauses** (MUST/MUST NOT
statements, enum definitions with exhaustive match requirements, struct field
constraints, state machine transitions, and acceptance criteria) are
content-hashed at Phase 0 and committed as `docs/invariant-hashes.toml`. Any
change to a hashed clause is classified as either a **clarification** or a
**weakening**:

- **Clarification** (allowed, `DocClarified`): adds specificity, resolves
  ambiguity, fixes a stale cross-reference, corrects an internal
  inconsistency. **Does not change any normative clause** -- the hashed
  content is unchanged, or the change is strictly additive (new specificity
  within an existing requirement). The hash updates in the same commit. CI
  verifies the new hash matches the new content.
- **Weakening** (forbidden, `WeakeningProposed`): removes a required
  condition, converts MUST to SHOULD, widens a terminal state, raises a limit
  constant, removes a test obligation, deletes an invariant or normative
  clause, or adds an exemption.

**Mechanism**: any diff to a hashed clause in `docs/invariant-hashes.toml`
classifies as `WeakeningProposed`. The agent writes to
`docs/proposed-amendments.md` (invariant ID, current clause, proposed
replacement, rationale) and **fails CI rather than resolving the
`Disagreement`**. The agent then continues with other runnable work -- this
is not a stall, since only a human can accept. Without the hash file, "does
this amendment weaken the invariant" is a judgment call made by the party who
benefits from the answer.

```rust
enum DocCodeDivergence {
    CodeMatchesDoc,
    DocClarified {
        invariant: InvariantId,
        rationale: String,
        event: EventId,
    },
    CodeFixed { invariant: InvariantId, commit: String },
    WeakeningProposed {       // CI FAILURE -- agent cannot resolve
        invariant: InvariantId,
        proposal: String,     // written to docs/proposed-amendments.md
    },
    Disagreement { invariant: InvariantId },  // CI FAILURE
}
```

CI check: for every `INV-xxx` tag in code, the corresponding invariant section
in this document must not contradict the implementation. For every invariant in
this document, at least one `INV-xxx` tag must exist in code. Any
`Disagreement` is a blocking CI failure. Any `WeakeningProposed` is also a
blocking CI failure (it is not a resolution, it is a request).

#### `#[flaky]` quarantine and invariant linkage

A test quarantined after 3 consecutive failures (see policy defaults table) is
a silently weakened invariant at the test level. Quarantine MUST create a task
linked to the test's `INV-xxx` tag. The linked invariant cannot reach
`VERIFIED` status while any of its tests are quarantined. This prevents
quarantine from becoming a mechanism that quietly removes verification
obligations.

### Known inconsistencies (fixed)

These were identified in the review and are fixed in place:

1. **47 vs. 51 tables**: line 14 said "47 SQLite tables", Phase 0 said "all 51
   tables." Both counts are wrong -- the actual count is whatever
   `sqlite_master` returns. The schema discovery step (RR-0117) is authoritative;
   fixed references now say "all tables" without a count.
2. **Duplicate L6 section headers**: two sections were labeled L6. Renumbered.
3. **`WorkerCommand::Steer` referenced in Phase 1 tests**: the enum in
   Invariant 5 already has `DeliverMessage(MessageId)`, not `Steer`. The test
   reference was stale. Fixed.
4. **`GateEvaluator::Deterministic(CheckFn)` as a closed construct**: merged
   into `VerifierKind` which is the single evaluation primitive, definable in
   config.

## Lessons from the Python system (fix these structurally, not by porting)

These are real incidents from the last 72 hours of operating amux at scale. Each one
points to an architectural flaw that the Rust rebuild must not inherit.

### L1: The 6MB board payload

The board API returns every card including full `desc` fields. One card has a 94KB
desc. The default response is 6.2MB, of which 4.4MB (74%) is desc text the dashboard
never renders (it shows `desc.split('\n')[0].slice(0, 80)`). Every SSE push, every
poll, every page load ships this. On a phone over cellular, this is the dominant
latency source.

**Rust fix**: the API has two shapes by design.
- **List responses** (`GET /api/board`, SSE pushes): `desc` truncated to first line,
  `desc_truncated: true` flag set. Full desc is never in a list payload.
- **Detail responses** (`GET /api/board/:id`): full desc, full log, full history.

This is not an optimization to add later. It is a response type definition:

```rust
#[derive(Serialize)]
struct BoardItemSummary {
    // all fields EXCEPT desc/log are full
    desc_preview: String,  // first line, max 200 chars
    desc_truncated: bool,
    // no `log` field at all
}

#[derive(Serialize)]
struct BoardItemDetail {
    // everything, full desc, full log
    desc: String,
    log: String,
}
```

Delta sync (Invariant 14) compounds this: after the initial load, the client receives
only changed items, not the full board. A single card status change pushes ~200 bytes
instead of 6.2MB.

### L2: Process-host mechanics must not leak above the backend adapter

The original tmux outage: the `=` prefix for exact session matching works for
session-level commands (`has-session`, `kill-session`) but silently fails for
pane-level commands (`capture-pane`, `send-keys`). Every capture and send-keys
across 62 sessions was silently failing, and the test suite only verified the
commands that happened to work.

The lesson is broader than "encapsulate tmux targeting." **Process-host-specific
mechanics must be confined to a replaceable backend adapter. amux must not depend on
terminal multiplexer behavior for correctness.** Each backend has its own addressing
semantics -- tmux pane targets vs. herdr agent references vs. PTY file descriptors
-- and all of them are implementation details behind `SessionBackend`.

**Rust fix**: the `SessionBackend` trait encapsulates all backend-specific interaction.
No raw `subprocess::Command` construction outside the backend module. The backend
conformance suite (Invariant 21) exercises every operation against every backend
implementation -- not just the ones that motivated the original fix.

```rust
impl HerdrBackend {
    fn agent_ref(&self, worker: &str) -> String {
        format!("amux-{}", worker)  // herdr agent reference
    }
    // Every herdr operation goes through this -- no raw agent name construction elsewhere
}

impl TmuxBackend {
    fn target(&self, worker: &str) -> String {
        format!("=amux-{}:", worker)  // exact + pane resolution
    }
    // Every tmux operation goes through this -- no raw "-t" construction elsewhere
}
```

### L3: Board items not flowing

380 todo items, 25 doing with no worker, steering messages piling up undelivered.
The orchestrator logic is scattered across pickup, advance-nudge, steering, and
snapshot -- and when any one piece breaks (as capture-pane did), the others don't
compensate. There is no single place that answers "why isn't this task moving?"

**Rust fix**: the explicit Orchestrator (Invariant 10) runs a stall check on every
tick. When it detects a stall, it produces a `StallViolation` with the reason:

```rust
// StallReason is the PROBLEM; WaitingFor (Invariant 10) is the STRUCTURED STATE.
// A StallViolation fires when a task has no WaitingFor and no assigned worker.
enum StallReason {
    WorkerIdle,                          // worker has capacity but isn't assigned
    NoCapableWorker,                     // no worker can do this work
    ProcessDown { error: String },       // backend reports process not running
    ProtocolUnreachable { error: String }, // OpenCode not responding
    Orphaned,                            // assigned to a worker that no longer exists
    CommandExpired { command: CommandId }, // precondition failed at delivery (Inv 38)
}
// Note: rate-limited, dependency-blocked, and gate-blocked are WaitingFor variants,
// not stalls. They have structured wait reasons and expected resolution paths.
```

The dashboard shows stall reasons inline on each card. A user looking at the board
can see exactly WHY each item is stuck, not just that it is.

### L4: No progress heartbeat

"I have no means of knowing if progress is continuing." The dashboard shows worker
status (active/idle/rate-limited) but not whether the fleet is making forward
progress. A worker can be "active" for 2 hours on a single task with no board
movement.

**Rust fix**: the Orchestrator emits a periodic `FleetProgress` event:

```rust
struct FleetProgress {
    timestamp: DateTime<Utc>,
    active_workers: u32,
    tasks_completed_last_hour: u32,
    tasks_completed_last_24h: u32,
    stall_violations: Vec<StallViolation>,
    longest_active_task: Option<(TaskId, Duration)>,
    queue_depth: u32,            // todo items with no worker assigned
    quarantined_count: u32,      // terminal failures (Invariant 47)
    blocked_count: u32,          // items with ExternalBlocker
    fleet_state: FleetState,     // Normal / CircuitOpen / Reconciling (Invariant 48)
    tokens_this_window: u64,     // rolling 4h window spend
}
```

The dashboard renders this as a compact status bar: "5 active, 3 completed/hr, 0
stalls" or "2 active, 0 completed/hr, 3 STALLS" (red). Clicking expands to the full
breakdown.

### L5: Server restart fragility

The Python server re-execs itself on every save of `amux-server.py`. On a shared
checkout with multiple sessions committing, this means uncontrolled restarts. A syntax
error in a commit takes the entire fleet's server down. The server process uses 888MB
RSS and takes 10+ seconds to restart.

**Rust fix**: the compiled binary cannot have syntax errors at runtime. Hot reload is
a `SIGHUP` handler that reloads configuration (`server.env`, gates, schedules) without
restarting the process. The binary is updated via a separate deploy step, not a file
watch. RSS target is <200MB.

### L6: Token waste -- model calls for string manipulation

The Python server makes model API calls (claude -p or Anthropic SDK) for tasks that
should be computed, not inferred:

| Call site | What it does | Tokens/call | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| Task title summarizer | `claude -p` to label a board card from a prompt | ~12-15k input | First clause of the prompt IS the title. No model needed. |
| Email event extractor | Haiku to parse event emails | ~3k input | Structured parsing with regex + date parser. Model call only for ambiguous cases. |
| Branch name suggester | Haiku to generate 4 git branch names | ~1k input | Template: `feat/{slug}`, `session/{slug}`, etc. No model needed. |
| Lookup endpoint | Haiku for general "ask Claude" queries | varies | This one is legitimate -- user-facing. |
| browser-use agent | Full Anthropic API call for browser automation | ~4k+ input | Legitimate when doing AI-driven browsing. |

The task summarizer was the worst offender (ethos rule 2: "are you calling the model
for something you could just compute?"). At 12-15k input tokens per call, with 62
workers each potentially firing one, that is up to 930k tokens per throttle window
for 3-word labels. It was throttled to once per 10 minutes per worker, which is why
most commands never reached the board at all -- the throttle was the symptom, not the
fix.

**Rust fix**: no model calls for string manipulation. The title deriver is
`prompt.split('\n')[0].split('.')[0][:80]` -- free, instant, no throttle needed,
every prompt gets a card. Model calls are reserved for judgment: "should this task
be decomposed?", "does this verification evidence satisfy the gate?" -- questions
where the answer depends on understanding, not formatting.

### L7: Browser profile management

Browser automation uses `browser-use` with Chrome profiles for persistent auth state.
The current system has:
- Profile creation via `POST /api/browser/profile/create`
- Profile listing, starting/stopping browser sessions
- Chrome profile path resolution (different between macOS/Linux)
- A bootstrap that patches `browser-use`'s `get_chrome_profile_path` at import time
- Profile cleanup and lock-file management
- Screenshots, CDP integration

Pain points:
- Profile path resolution is fragile (macOS vs Linux, `Default` subdirectory
  inconsistency that caused browser-use to create profiles in the wrong location)
- Browser sessions that don't close properly leave Chrome lock files, blocking the
  next start
- No profile inventory -- you can't see which profiles have which saved logins
- The `browser-use` Python dependency pulls in heavy model deps even when you just
  want profile management

**Rust fix**: browser profiles are a first-class subsystem:

```rust
struct BrowserProfile {
    name: String,
    chrome_data_dir: PathBuf,
    created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    last_used: Option<DateTime<Utc>>,
    saved_domains: Vec<String>,  // domains with saved auth cookies
    size_bytes: u64,
}

struct BrowserSession {
    profile: String,
    pid: Option<u32>,
    cdp_port: u16,
    started_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    screenshots: Vec<PathBuf>,
}
```

- Profile CRUD is native (no Python browser-use dependency for management)
- Chrome is launched directly via CDP flags, not through a Python wrapper
- Lock files are cleaned up on server start (reconciliation)
- Profile inventory shows saved auth domains
- Screenshots use CDP directly (`Page.captureScreenshot`)
- The Anthropic model call is separate from the browser control -- you can use
  profiles without burning tokens

### L8: 114 registered sessions, 62 running, 67 with no status

Half the registered sessions are just `.env` files with no running process. The
dashboard shows all 114 with no visual distinction. A user sees 67 blank entries mixed
in with 47 real workers.

**Rust fix**: workers that are stopped are in a collapsed "Stopped" section by
default. The main view shows only running + recently-active workers. The worker count
in the header shows "6 active / 41 idle / 67 stopped" -- three numbers, not one.

## What does NOT change

- Self-signed TLS on port 8822
- `~/.amux/` directory structure
- `server.env` config mechanism
- API route paths and response shapes (dashboard compatibility)
- The ethos: the harness gets better as the models get better

### ADR-001: SQLite per-tenant files (committed)

**Decision**: SQLite remains the data store. Multi-tenant isolation uses one
SQLite file per org/tenant, not a shared Postgres instance.

**Rationale**:
- Preserves the single-writer design that Python's GIL accidentally enforced.
  Postgres invalidates it and introduces connection pooling, migrations,
  schema drift, and a new class of "the pool is exhausted" failures.
- Per-tenant files give free isolation: one tenant's backup, restore, export,
  or corruption cannot affect another.
- WAL mode already handles concurrent readers (dashboard, SSE, CLI).
- The single-writer task serializes writes within a tenant; cross-tenant writes
  are independent (no global lock).
- Migration path is simpler: copy the file, run the migration, start the new
  server. Rollback is: copy the file back.

**Consequences**:
- Cross-tenant queries (admin dashboard, fleet metrics) require opening
  multiple DB files or maintaining a separate aggregate store.
- Tenant count is bounded by filesystem handles (~1000 practical limit).
- Schema migrations must be applied to every tenant file. A migration runner
  iterates tenant files at startup.

**Status**: committed. Do not reopen without a concrete use case that
per-tenant SQLite cannot serve.

## What changes

- `sessions` -> `workers` everywhere
- Implicit orchestrator -> explicit Orchestrator with typed assignments and leases
- Flat board -> dependency graph with typed relations
- String-based scope -> four-tier Org/Global/Group/Worker with deterministic inheritance
- Terminal scraping as control plane -> OpenCode structured agent protocol for
  commands/events/lifecycle, with herdr/tmux/native PTY as process hosts
- tmux as sole backend -> herdr primary process host, tmux fallback, native PTY future
- Implicit agent interaction -> OpenCode for structured semantics, herdr for hosting
- `done` as final state -> `done` (worker claim) vs `verified` (harness conclusion)
- 30 Python threads -> single tokio select! loop + spawned tasks
- Port doc -> system invariant doc with behavioral acceptance tests

## Autonomous Execution Contract

This section defines the execution semantics that make this document sufficient for
an autonomous agent to receive the instruction `execute` and continue until the
rebuild is complete. The Execution Checklist at the bottom is the system of record.
Everything above defines WHAT; this section and the checklist define HOW, WHEN, and
WHAT COUNTS.

### Definition of Verified

A checklist item may be marked `VERIFIED` only when all applicable verification
layers pass. Not every item uses every layer, but the checklist states which are
applicable.

```
Layer                          Applies to
─────────────────────────────  ──────────────────────────────────
Implementation                 all items
Unit tests                     all code items
Integration tests              all subsystem items
Backend conformance            worker, session, orchestrator items
Provider conformance           provider, capacity, routing items
API verification               all server-side items
CLI verification               all CLI-exposed items
Browser UI verification        all dashboard-visible items
Visual/rendering               layout-sensitive UI items
Persistence/restart            all durable-state items
Migration (existing data)      all data-bearing subsystems
Migration (net-new data)       all data-bearing subsystems
Offline behavior               all user-facing mutations
Sync/reconciliation            all SSE/revision items
Audit/event provenance         all state transitions
Searchability                  all entity types
Performance                    latency/memory-sensitive items
```

Statuses:

```
TODO            — not started
IN_PROGRESS     — implementation underway
BLOCKED         — external dependency prevents progress (documented)
IMPLEMENTED     — code exists but NOT verified
VERIFYING       — acceptance tests running
VERIFIED        — all applicable layers pass with evidence
```

Only `VERIFIED` counts as complete. `IMPLEMENTED` explicitly does NOT mean complete.

### Migration requirements

The Rust implementation must migrate real existing AMUX data, not merely create
equivalent fresh data.

**Before changing anything**, inventory the existing Python installation. Record
counts and checksums where feasible for every durable data category:

```
workers/sessions                worker configuration
groups                          board tasks
columns                         task relationships
gates                           messages/history
schedules                       schedule runs
memories                        prefs/settings
browser profiles metadata
email metadata                  calendar events
files/file metadata             interaction/event history
token/cost ledger               integration configuration
MCP configuration               alerts
journal                         other SQLite tables
```

Do not assume the documented table count remains current. Discover the actual schema:
`SELECT name FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' ORDER BY name;`

**Migration manifest** -- one row per source entity, with EXPLICIT schema translation:

```
source table/entity      -> destination table/entity
source column (type)     -> destination column (type)   [transformation if any]
source row count         -> destination row count
migration method            validation method
status: Migrated / Intentionally Transformed / Intentionally Deprecated
```

Every table requires a column-level mapping. Not just "table A -> table B" but every
column in A mapped to its destination in B with the type conversion documented.
Examples of translations that must be explicit:

- `sessions.name` (TEXT) -> `workers.display_name` (TEXT) [table + column rename]
- `sessions.name` -> `workers.name_aliases` (TEXT[]) [old name becomes alias]
- `board.status` (TEXT "todo"/"doing"/"done"/"verified") -> `tasks.status` (BoardStatus enum)
- `board.type` (TEXT) -> `tasks.task_type` (TaskType enum)
- `board.owner_type` (TEXT) -> `tasks.owner_type` (OwnerType enum)
- `board.created` (REAL epoch) -> `tasks.created_at` (DateTime<Utc>)
- `board.desc` (TEXT) -> `tasks.desc` (TEXT) + `tasks.desc_preview` (TEXT, computed)
- `board.log` (TEXT) -> `durable_events` entries (parsed where structured, legacy otherwise)
- `interaction_log.ts` (INTEGER, MILLISECONDS) -> `events.timestamp` (DateTime<Utc>)
  [known incident: two sessions treated ms as seconds; the migration must divide by 1000]
- `prefs.value` (TEXT, JSON string) -> typed pref values with validation
- `memories.scope` (TEXT) -> `memories.scope` (MemoryScope enum)
- `schedules.session` (TEXT, session name) -> `schedules.worker_id` (WorkerId)
- `messages.sender` (TEXT) -> `messages.sender_id` (WorkerId, via migration mapping)

The manifest is committed as machine-readable JSON/TOML, not only prose. A CI check
validates that every source column appears in the manifest and every destination column
has a documented source.

For every source row/entity, it must be one of:
- **Migrated** -- exists in Rust with equivalent semantics
- **Intentionally transformed** -- exists with documented changes (transformation
  logic explicit, including renames, type conversions, computed fields, splits, merges)
- **Intentionally deprecated** -- removed with explicit reason, approval if semantic
  data would be lost, and preservation/export path where appropriate

Nothing may silently disappear. A column that exists in the source but not the
destination is a bug in the manifest, not an implicit deprecation.

**Every major subsystem must be tested two ways:**

1. **Existing-data path**: use data migrated from Python and prove it works in Rust.
   Open a migrated task, search migrated messages, run a migrated schedule, start a
   migrated worker, view migrated logs, resolve migrated scoped config, access migrated
   browser profile metadata, view migrated email threads, check migrated calendar events
   in iCal feed, verify migrated group scope resolution,
   confirm migrated token ledger totals, exercise migrated memories with scope isolation.

2. **Net-new path**: create new data through the Rust system and prove the complete
   lifecycle works. Create worker, rename worker, change cwd, change model, change
   provider, create group, create task, create gate with dependency, create schedule,
   send message with @mention, upload file, compose email, create calendar event, create
   create browser profile, create memory, perform universal search, go
   offline and reconnect, verify token usage recorded.

A subsystem is not verified if only migration works or only fresh creation works.

### Migration rehearsal

Before production cutover:

1. Clone/copy the current production AMUX data (DB file + `~/.amux/` state).
2. Run migration end-to-end against the copy.
3. Run all migration validation (manifest reconciliation).
4. Start Rust server on migrated copy.
5. Run browser/UI/CLI/API verification.
6. Run representative workers through Herdr.
7. Test offline/reconnect.
8. Generate migration report.
9. Destroy rehearsal copy.
10. Repeat from a fresh production snapshot for actual cutover.

The first attempt must not happen against the only copy of production data.

### Herdr acceptance criteria

Herdr is the default backend. The rebuild is not complete merely because
`HerdrBackend` compiles. Verification must include real Herdr-backed E2E execution.

**Mandatory Herdr golden scenario:**

```
create worker (Herdr backend)
  → Herdr agent/session created
  → create/assign task
  → worker executes via OpenCode AgentProtocol
  → messages deliver at turn boundary
  → status updates flow through SSE
  → logs appear in structured events
  → rate-limit state representable
  → context/turn tracking works
  → task progresses through board states
  → verification executes
  → task reaches verified
  → restart AMUX server
  → reconcile worker/session state
  → continue functioning normally
```

**Additional Herdr verification:**

- Worker rename with active Herdr session (session continues, no orphan)
- Worker cwd change with Herdr (session replaced atomically)
- Worker model change with Herdr (hot-switch or session restart)
- Worker provider change with Herdr (session restart, state preserved)
- AMUX restart while Herdr agent process exists (reconciliation)
- Herdr process disappears unexpectedly (detect, report, recover)
- Stale Herdr process discovered during reconciliation (clean up)
- Multiple concurrent Herdr workers (10+, no cross-talk)
- 40-worker load/conformance target (Herdr-backed)

tmux must pass the same `SessionBackend` conformance contract as fallback, but
successful Herdr verification is mandatory for release.

### Browser verification depth

DOM existence is not proof that something rendered correctly. For meaningful layout
components, assert:

- Nonzero bounding boxes
- Expected visibility
- No unintended clipping
- No viewport overflow on desktop and mobile
- Modal/menu position correct
- Correct stacking (z-index)
- Usable touch targets (>= 44px on mobile)
- Mobile geometry at 375px
- Scroll behavior

Test at minimum: desktop Chromium, mobile viewport (375px), touch-enabled
configuration. If practical, include WebKit/iOS tests for PWA-critical flows.

**Deep nested workflows to test:**

1. Board card edit: open board -> open card -> open menu -> edit -> focus field ->
   type -> press Enter -> observe loading -> receive API response -> observe toast ->
   receive SSE reconciliation -> verify final card state.

2. Drag/drop with gate rejection: drag task -> optimistic move -> gate rejects
   with 409 -> gate UI appears -> card returns correctly -> satisfy gate -> retry ->
   task moves -> toast appears -> backend and UI revisions agree.

3. Worker model change: open worker -> settings -> change model -> save -> session
   replacement if needed -> state remains -> model indicator updates -> send message ->
   new model answers.

4. Worker rename: rename worker -> save -> list updates -> detail title updates ->
   @old-name alias still resolves -> @new-name resolves -> task ownership unchanged ->
   Herdr session continues/reconciles.

5. Worker cwd change: change cwd -> replacement session starts -> correct directory
   visible -> task/context preserved -> old session retired -> work continues.

### Fault injection

Provide deterministic test-harness fault injection for:

```
API 400                        API 401/403
API 409 (conflict)             API 429 (rate limit)
API 500                        timeout
latency injection              connection loss
server restart                 worker crash
Herdr process loss             provider rate limit
provider unavailable           dropped SSE events
duplicate SSE events           out-of-order SSE events
missed revision                offline during mutation
offline during message         restart during sync
```

Test-only controls must never be exposed in production (`#[cfg(test)]` or equivalent).
Every fault scenario asserts eventual consistency or an explicit durable blocked/error
state.

### Independent verification evidence

Testing must verify outcomes, not implementation activity.

| Bad | Good |
|---|---|
| Process produced output | Agent performed operation, result independently verifiable |
| Worker says tests passed | Test harness independently executes tests, captures exit status |
| Page contains HTML | AMUX-specific hydrated component is visible, interactive, correct |
| Message was inserted into terminal | MessageId progressed through durable delivery semantics |

### Persistent-data restart tests

For every durable subsystem:

```
create/mutate data
  → stop Rust server
  → restart Rust server
  → reconcile state
  → read through API → correct
  → read through CLI → correct
  → inspect in UI → correct
  → verify unchanged/correct
```

For worker-backed functionality, also test Herdr state reconciliation after restart.

### Offline verification

For each applicable UI mutation, classify its offline behavior:

```
offline-capable and queued     — mutation works offline, replays on reconnect
read-only from cache           — data viewable but not mutable offline
requires server                — explicitly disabled with clear indicator
conflict-aware                 — offline mutation may conflict with server state
```

Offline-capable operations must be tested:

```
online baseline
  → disconnect
  → mutate
  → verify optimistic UI
  → reconnect
  → replay
  → backend accepts
  → SSE/revision reconciliation
  → final UI equals backend
  → no duplicate side effect
```

### UI/backend convergence

The backend database is authoritative. Every durable mutation receives a global
revision and entity version (Invariant 35). The browser must:

- Ignore stale events (rev <= last seen)
- Deduplicate duplicate events (same rev)
- Detect revision gaps (missing rev)
- Delta-sync missing events (`/api/sync?since_rev=N`)
- Reconcile after reconnect, tab wake, server restart

**Convergence E2E tests:**

- Drop every 5th SSE event -> client detects gap, delta syncs, converges
- Deliver duplicate event -> client deduplicates, no phantom state
- Deliver events out of order -> client applies in rev order
- Disconnect/reconnect -> delta sync fills gap
- Two browser tabs concurrently editing same task -> both converge
- Offline mutation conflicting with newer backend state -> conflict resolution
- 1000 rapid board changes -> final UI equals final backend state

### Historical incident regression corpus

Create regression tests for architectural failure classes from the AMUX Git history:

```
incident_regression::duplicate_draft_resurrects_sent_message
incident_regression::board_read_after_write_staleness
incident_regression::stale_cache_overwrites_newer_state
incident_regression::duplicate_plan_seeding
incident_regression::session_record_exists_process_dead
incident_regression::rate_limit_glyph_rendering_difference
incident_regression::backend_delivery_false_success
incident_regression::provider_smoke_passes_on_shell_prompt
incident_regression::verification_matches_echoed_prompt
incident_regression::tls_error_page_passes_health_check
incident_regression::missing_cache_invalidation
incident_regression::stale_queued_automation
incident_regression::journal_treated_as_executable_issue
incident_regression::manual_vs_scheduled_run_provenance
incident_regression::browser_profile_split_brain
incident_regression::spend_writers_overwriting
incident_regression::process_restart_loses_oauth_state
incident_regression::hidden_swallowed_exception
incident_regression::gates_derived_from_stale_type
incident_regression::dom_correct_zero_rendered_height
```

Each test references the incident/commit where useful. The Rust rebuild is not
successful if it can reproduce a known architectural incident.

### Live capability audit (Phase 0 discovery)

The Rust rebuild must achieve parity with the **live amux server's actual
capabilities**, not just the API routes listed in the plan. The Python server
has ~165 unique API route paths across ~50 subsystems. Some of these are
essential capabilities the plan's RR items must cover; others are personal or
experimental features that can be intentionally deprecated.

**Mechanism**: at Phase 0, the agent runs an automated audit against the live
server (RR-0028m). For each subsystem, it classifies every route:

```
Covered      — an RR item exists and specifies this capability
Deprecated   — intentionally not ported, with recorded rationale
Gap          — no RR item, needs one (creates an RR item automatically)
```

The audit output is committed as `docs/capability-audit.toml` and reconciled
against the RR checklist. Any `Gap` produces a new RR item in the appropriate
phase. The audit re-runs at Phase 11 as part of the final parity check.

**Known gaps identified from the live server** (as of 2026-08-09):

Capabilities the plan covers but whose depth needs verification:

| Capability | Live routes | Plan coverage | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **File upload to worker** | `/api/upload/start`, `/api/upload/:id/chunk/:i`, `/api/upload/:id/finish` | Partial (RR-0093 covers files browse/upload/download) | Chunked upload with drag-and-drop into worker peek input is a distinct flow from the files dashboard. Worker peek accepts dropped files, uploads via chunked protocol, attaches path to the outbound message. This must be an explicit test in the worker send/message flow, not only in the files tab. |
| **Git integration** | `/api/sessions-git`, `/api/git-branches`, `/api/suggest-branch`, `/api/settings/commit-guard` | Partial (worker peek shows git state) | Branch suggestions, tracked-files, staged-guard are worker-scoped git features used daily. |
| **Slash commands + skills** | `/api/slash-commands/*`, `/api/skills/*` | Not covered | Worker-scoped command registry. Skills are user-defined automation. |
| **Saved messages** | `/api/saved-messages/*` | Not covered | Bookmarked messages for quick re-send. |
| **Usage/stats** | `/api/usage`, `/api/stats/daily` | Partial (token budgets in Inv 16) | Daily usage dashboard, cost tracking. |
| **Layout presets** | `/api/layout-presets/*` | Not covered | Dashboard layout persistence. |

Capabilities that need a deliberate keep/deprecate decision:

| Capability | Live routes | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|
| **Dictation/TTS** | `/api/dictation/*`, `/api/tts/*` | Keep if voice input is used; deprecate if unused. |
| **Journal** | `/api/journal/*` | Keep -- personal logging with media. |
| **Map/pins** | `/api/map/*` | Deprecate unless actively used. |
| **Habits** | `/api/habits` | Deprecate unless actively used. |
| **Torrents** | `/api/torrents/*` | Deprecate unless actively used. |
| **Tunnel** | `/api/tunnel/*` | Keep -- reverse proxy for public URLs (calendar feed, etc.). |
| **Recordings** | `/api/recordings` | Keep if session recordings are used. |
| **Skins/branding** | `/api/skins`, `/api/branding/*` | Keep -- UI theming is user-facing. |
| **Templates** | `/api/templates` | Keep -- message templates. |
| **Reports** | `/api/reports/*` | Keep -- generated reports (review digest, weekly). |
| **SQL explorer** | `/api/sql/*` | Keep -- power-user database inspection. |
| **Speedtest** | `/api/speedtest/*` | Deprecate -- diagnostic, rarely used. |
| **iTerm2** | `/api/iterm2/sessions` | Deprecate -- backend-specific. |
| **SMS** | `/api/sms` | Keep -- alert channel (wired to owner alert). |
| **Interactions/replay** | `/api/interactions/*` | Keep -- interaction logging and replay. |

The recommendations above are starting points. The Phase 0 audit (RR-0028m)
produces the authoritative classification after reviewing actual usage data.
Any capability classified as `Deprecated` must have a rationale recorded in
`docs/capability-audit.toml` -- silent omission is the failure mode this
audit exists to prevent.

### Final parity audit

Before retiring Python, automatically compare Python and Rust behavior. Inventory:

- API routes (all 212+ method/path combos, reconciled against `docs/capability-audit.toml`)
- Request/response shapes
- CLI commands
- Dashboard actions
- Database entities
- Scheduled jobs
- Integrations
- Worker operations (including file upload into worker input)
- Prefs/config
- Search
- Offline capabilities

Every current Python capability must be classified:

```
Parity              — identical behavior in Rust
Improved/replaced   — better behavior, documented difference
Intentionally deprecated — removed with explicit reason
```

No unknown/missing capability is acceptable.

2. Real existing Python AMUX data has been migrated successfully.
3. All applicable features work for migrated data AND newly-created data.
4. API, CLI, browser, Herdr, offline, sync, restart, and failure tests pass.
5. Every Execution Checklist item is `VERIFIED`.
6. There are no unexplained parity gaps.
7. The final verification report is generated:

```
RUST REBUILD: VERIFIED

Checklist: X/X verified

Remaining blockers: 0
```

Anything less means the executor should continue working.

### Acceptance suite vs permanent regression suite

The Rust rebuild requires a comprehensive **Acceptance Test Suite** derived directly
from this document. This suite serves two purposes and its lifecycle extends beyond
the rebuild itself.

#### 1. Rebuild acceptance

During implementation and migration, the acceptance suite proves the Rust system
satisfies the complete `docs/rust-rebuild-plan.md` contract.

Every applicable `RR-XXXX` checklist item must map to one or more acceptance tests.
A checklist item may only become `VERIFIED` when its mapped acceptance tests and
required evidence pass.

The acceptance suite exercises:

- Migrated production data AND net-new Rust-created data
- API behavior, CLI behavior, real browser behavior
- Deep nested UI interactions (not just DOM existence)
- Herdr-backed workers AND tmux fallback
- Provider behavior (Claude, Gemini, Codex, Ollama)
- Model/provider/backend/cwd/worker configuration changes
- Board lifecycle, gates, dependencies, leases
- Messages, @worker mentions, delivery semantics
- Schedules, search, logs, compaction, memory
- Token accounting, provider quotas, capacity routing
- Browser profiles, email, calendar
- Persistence/restart, offline operation
- Conflict resolution, realtime UI reconciliation
- Failures and recovery (fault injection)
- Migration integrity (manifest reconciliation)
- Auto-discovered UX interaction graph (Invariant 46)
- Historical incident regressions
- Performance and soak requirements

Passing ordinary unit tests is not sufficient for rebuild acceptance.

#### 2. Permanent regression protection

After the Rust rebuild is accepted and becomes production, the acceptance suite does
NOT disappear. The relevant portions become the permanent **AMUX Regression Suite**
and run continuously in CI/CD.

> **Every behavior required to accept the rebuild becomes protected behavior after
> the rebuild.**

A future PR must not be able to silently regress something that was required for
Rust acceptance. The suite evolves as:

```
Rust rebuild specification
        ↓
RR execution checklist
        ↓
Acceptance tests (prove the rebuild)
        ↓
Rust production acceptance
        ↓
Permanent CI/CD regression suite (protect the rebuild forever)
```

Acceptance testing is the source of truth for product behavior; CI/CD is the
mechanism that continuously re-runs it.

> **The Rust rebuild acceptance suite becomes AMUX's permanent regression suite.
> The rewrite is not merely tested once; its verified behavior becomes the baseline
> that every future commit must continue to satisfy.**

#### Test classification

Every acceptance test must be tagged by execution class so CI runs the correct
subsets efficiently:

```
unit                   integration           simulation
property               api                   cli
browser                browser-mobile        offline
sync                   herdr                 tmux
provider-claude        provider-codex        provider-gemini
provider-ollama        migration             historical-regression
performance            soak                  destructive
production-smoke
```

Do not duplicate test logic to create a faster CI tier. Reuse the same scenario/fixture
definitions at different scales where possible.

#### CI tiers (permanent, post-migration)

##### PR Fast Gate

Runs on every PR. Must complete quickly enough to be practical (target: < 10 min).

```
cargo check + clippy
unit tests
deterministic orchestrator simulations
property tests (bounded cases)
API contract tests (schema validation)
MockBackend conformance
MockProvider conformance
migration/schema compatibility tests
targeted Playwright smoke for modified surfaces
static interaction-coverage validation (DOM inventory vs registry)
fast deterministic historical regressions
```

No PR merges if this fails.

##### PR Full Gate

Runs for every merge candidate or protected-branch update.

```
all unit + integration tests
Herdr backend conformance
tmux backend conformance
provider adapter conformance (Claude, Gemini, Codex, Ollama)
full API suite
full CLI suite
full browser interaction suite (desktop + mobile)
offline/reconnect suite
SSE/revision/fault-injection suite
config mutation tests (rename, cwd, model, provider, backend)
historical incident regression corpus (full)
migrated-data fixture suite
net-new-data suite
```

No production deployment if this fails.

##### Nightly deep gate

Expensive scenarios that should not slow every PR:

```
complete multi-provider golden scenarios (all 10)
high-volume UI interaction crawling
40+ Herdr worker concurrency
thousands of deterministic simulation/fuzz runs
extended property testing (higher case count)
migration against recent sanitized production snapshot
browser matrix (Chromium + WebKit where available)
performance benchmark suite (p50/p95/p99 baselines)
resource leak tests (FD, RSS over 4h)
fault-injection matrix (all 18 fault types)
```

##### Release gate

Before any production deployment:

```
all Full Gate tests green
current-release migration dry-run green
real Herdr golden scenario green (not mock)
offline suite green
UI interaction coverage: zero unexplained holes
production smoke tests defined for the release green
```

##### Periodic soak gate

Run independently (weekly or on-demand):

```
24h Rust server soak
sustained Herdr worker lifecycle churn
repeated session replacement (cwd/provider/backend changes)
provider rate-limit/recovery cycling
DB growth and compaction under continuous writes
SSE reconnect churn (connect/disconnect cycles)
browser/offline reconnect cycles
file descriptor leak detection (48h)
RSS leak detection (48h)
```

#### Spec-to-test traceability

The repository must maintain machine-readable traceability between requirements and
tests:

```
Requirement: RR-0035
Acceptance tests:
  worker_rename::api_preserves_worker_id
  worker_rename::cli_alias_resolves
  worker_rename::ui_list_updates
  worker_rename::herdr_session_continues
  worker_rename::restart_preserves_alias
```

The Execution Checklist records test IDs in its `Evidence:` field upon verification.

CI must validate:

1. Every `RR-XXXX` requirement has at least one mapped test unless explicitly marked
   documentation-only.
2. Every `VERIFIED` requirement's tests currently exist and pass.
3. Tests referenced by checklist items have not been deleted or renamed without
   updating the requirement.
4. Newly introduced user-facing capabilities have acceptance requirements and tests.

A feature must not become unprotected because someone removed its test accidentally.

#### UI interaction coverage is permanent

The deep UI interaction inventory is not only a rebuild exercise. Every CI run
compares the rendered interactive UI inventory against registered interaction
contracts:

```
UI controls discovered:           493
controls with semantic IDs:       493
registered interaction actions:   721
covered actions:                  721
uncovered:                          0
```

If a PR adds `<button data-action-id="worker-change-model">` without adding the
appropriate behavioral acceptance test, CI fails. If a component is removed, its
associated interaction tests and requirement mappings must be intentionally updated.

#### Test the behavior, not just the implementation

Permanent CI must preserve the acceptance philosophy:

```
API handler exists               != behavior verified
DOM node exists                  != UI verified
process is alive                 != worker verified
terminal accepted keystrokes     != message delivered
worker said "done"               != task verified
cache contains data              != UI is current
```

Tests assert the externally observable contract, not implementation internals.

#### Migrated-data regression fixtures

After successful migration, preserve a sanitized representative fixture derived from
the real Python AMUX dataset. The permanent CI suite uses this fixture to ensure
future migrations/schema changes continue to support historically valid AMUX data.

Include representative examples of:

- Old workers/sessions with legacy config shapes
- Old board task shapes, legacy statuses/types
- Messages with threading and delivery states
- Groups with scoped configuration
- Schedules with run history and source discrimination
- Memory entries with scope and provenance
- Token ledger entries
- Prefs in legacy format
- Browser profile metadata
- Integration configuration
- Historical edge cases (451-fold cards, archived-with-gate, etc.)

Future migrations must load this fixture successfully and preserve its semantics.

#### Historical bugs stay fixed forever

Every historical incident converted into a regression test becomes permanent.
Do not delete a historical regression because the implementation that originally
caused it no longer exists. The purpose of the test is to preserve the behavioral
invariant:

```
no read-after-write stale board
no sent-message resurrection
no duplicate seed convergence
no stale automation delivery
no false-positive verification from echoed prompts
no "healthy" provider based on shell output
no split-brain browser profile store
no silent provider-state inference failure
no lost state during restart
no gates derived from stale item type
no zero-height rendered component passing checks
```

Implementation can change completely; these behaviors must remain protected.

#### Performance regressions are regressions

The performance targets defined by this document become CI baselines after acceptance.
Track at minimum:

```
API p50/p95/p99 per route group
dashboard cold and cached load time
SSE propagation latency (state change -> client)
worker start latency (button press -> running)
search latency (query -> results)
idle CPU (40 workers parked)
RSS (40 workers parked)
DB write throughput (mutations/sec)
context assembly time
token overhead (harness tokens / productive tokens)
tokens per verified task
```

After the accepted Rust baseline is established, CI compares future changes against
it. Material regression outside defined tolerance fails the appropriate gate.

#### Acceptance-suite completion criterion

The rebuild may only pass final acceptance when:

```
Every RR requirement has verification evidence
AND every applicable acceptance test is green
AND migrated production data passes
AND net-new data passes
AND real Herdr workflows pass
AND browser/UI deep interaction coverage passes
AND auto-discovered UX graph reconciles with RR checklist (Invariant 46)
AND UX discovery coverage report has zero unexplained holes
AND offline/reconciliation passes
AND historical regressions pass
AND performance/reliability gates pass
```

The manually-written golden scenarios answer "what is this path supposed to mean?"
and the auto-discovered UX graph answers "what paths exist?". Both pass. No path
exists without a test, no test claims a path that cannot be reached.

After that moment, these tests become the permanent minimum behavioral contract for
AMUX. Future functionality must extend this contract, not bypass it.

## Execution Checklist

This is the authoritative system of record for the Rust rebuild. Every implementation
requirement elsewhere in this document maps to at least one checklist item. The
checklist is maintained in this document -- there is no separate TODO file.

An autonomous agent starts here: find the first incomplete item whose dependencies are
all `VERIFIED`, implement it, verify it, mark it, commit, continue.

**Notation:**
- `Phase:` which migration phase this belongs to
- `Depends on:` items that must be `VERIFIED` first
- `Invariant:` which system invariant(s) this implements
- `Verify:` which verification layers apply (from §Definition of Verified)
- `Status:` TODO / IN_PROGRESS / BLOCKED / IMPLEMENTED / VERIFYING / VERIFIED
- `Evidence:` what was produced to justify VERIFIED (filled in during execution)

Items are grouped by phase. Within a phase, items may be worked in any order
consistent with their dependencies.

    delivery, event streaming (turn start/end, progress, tool use), rate-limit
    detection, graceful shutdown. Record a coverage matrix.
    Written branch: if OpenCode coverage < 3 of 4 providers for core lifecycle
    events, TerminalAdapter promotes from fallback to peer of OpenCodeAdapter.
    Provider coverage matrix in Phase 4 gets rewritten accordingly.
  Tests: coverage matrix committed, all four providers tested, branch decision recorded

- [x] RR-0028j — Invariant hash infrastructure (normative clause protection)
  Phase: 0
  Depends on: RR-0001
  Invariant: 45
  Requirement: Generate docs/invariant-hashes.toml at Phase 0 containing
    content hashes of every invariant's normative clauses. CI check:
    DocCodeDivergence classification (CodeMatchesDoc, DocClarified,
    WeakeningProposed, Disagreement). WeakeningProposed and Disagreement
    are CI failures. Agent may apply DocClarified (hash updates in same
    commit). Agent may NOT apply weakenings -- records proposed amendment
    in docs/proposed-amendments.md. Flaky test quarantine creates task
    linked to INV-xxx; linked invariant cannot reach VERIFIED while
    quarantined.
  Tests: hash generation covers all invariants, clarification updates hash,

  Phase: 0
  Depends on: RR-0001, RR-0003
  Invariant: 33, 10, 49
  Requirement: IsolationPolicy enum (Shared, Worktree, Container). Scoped
    via Invariant 2. WaitingFor::TreeConflict { holder: WorkerId, path }.
    Under Shared, cargo test exit code is tree-level not worker-level
    evidence. AttemptRecord under Shared includes git status at failure
    time. Acceptance criteria needing per-worker attribution must declare
    Worktree.
  Tests: TreeConflict is a structured wait not a stall, Shared isolation
    records tree status in AttemptRecord

- [x] RR-0028l — Phase 1+4 re-estimate if OpenCode spike triggers written branch
  Phase: 0
  Depends on: RR-0028e
  Invariant: 45
  Requirement: If the OpenCode spike (RR-0028e) coverage matrix shows < 3/4
    providers with core lifecycle coverage and the written branch fires
    (TerminalAdapter promoted to peer of OpenCodeAdapter), Phases 1 and 4 must
    be re-estimated before Phase 1 begins. The re-estimate accounts for dual
    adapter paths in the orchestrator (Phase 1) and provider coverage matrix
    rewrite (Phase 4). Record the re-estimate as an amendment to the phase
    timeline table.
  Tests: written-branch decision recorded in docs/provider-coverage.csv,
    phase re-estimates committed if triggered
  Verify: Implementation
  Status: IMPLEMENTED
  Evidence: Written branch did NOT fire (3/4 coverage). No re-estimate needed. Decision recorded in docs/opencode-spike-results.md.

  Phase: 0
  Depends on: RR-0001
  Invariant: 45
  Requirement: Automated audit of the live amux Python server's API routes
    (~165 unique paths, ~50 subsystems) against the RR checklist. For each
    route, classify as Covered (RR item exists), Deprecated (intentional,
    rationale recorded), or Gap (needs an RR item). Output committed as
    docs/capability-audit.toml. Any Gap produces a new RR item in the
    appropriate phase. Key capabilities to verify coverage for:
    - Chunked file upload to worker input (drag-drop into peek, /api/upload/*)
    - Git integration (branches, staged-guard, tracked-files)
    - Slash commands + skills registry
    - Saved messages, templates, layout presets
    - Usage/stats dashboard
    - Journal, tunnel, recordings, skins/branding, reports, SQL explorer
    - SMS (alert channel), interactions/replay
    Capabilities classified Deprecated must have rationale -- silent omission
    is the failure mode. Audit re-runs at Phase 11 as final parity check.
  Tests: audit covers all live routes, no unclassified routes, Gap items
    have corresponding RR entries

  Phase: 4
  Depends on: RR-0003, RR-0043, RR-0044
  Invariant: 16, 24
  Requirement: Every worker can have spend limits scoped by model via
    `WorkerConfig.model_budgets`. Budget enforcement is two-tier:
    1. **Native** (Managed Agents): `ProviderSessionSpec.budget` passed to
       `start_session`. Provider emits `budget_reached` -> adapter translates
       to `WorkerEvent::BudgetPaused`. `raise_budget` resumes the session.
    2. **Local** (all other providers): amux's `SelfAccounting` token counting
       enforces. Worker command queue pauses when budget hit.
    Budgets scoped via Invariant 2 (Global/Group/Worker). Group-level budget
    applies to all members unless overridden. Dashboard shows per-worker spend
    by model with warning/paused states. CLI: `amux worker budget <worker>
    --model <model> --limit <amount> --window <daily|weekly|rolling:4h>`.
    `amux worker budget <worker> --raise <new-limit>` resumes a paused worker.

  Phase: 4
  Depends on: RR-0043, RR-0044
  Invariant: 20, 22
  Requirement: When a provider hits rate limit or subscription exhaustion, the
    orchestrator coordinates ALL workers on that provider — not each discovering
    independently. ProviderFleetState tracks affected workers and parked commands.
    No user intervention required at any step:
    1. First worker hits limit -> ProviderState transitions to QuotaExhausted
    2. Orchestrator stops new assignments to ALL workers on this provider
    3. Workers with fallback chains redistribute to fallback providers
    4. Workers without fallbacks enter rate_limited execution state, commands queue
    5. On reset: workers resume STAGGERED (configurable interval, default 5s)
       to prevent thundering herd
    Subscription exhaustion (monthly plan out) follows same flow with longer
    reset_at. Dashboard shows: provider exhausted, reset time, N workers parked,
    M redistributed to fallback. Replaces the Python server's regex-based
    rate-limit watchdog with structural ProviderState the orchestrator reasons
    about directly.
    Simulation coverage (Invariant 22): rate-limit -> park -> redistribute ->
    reset -> staggered resume -> all workers productive, zero user interaction.
  Tests: fleet-wide pause on single worker rate limit, staggered resume,
    fallback redistribution, subscription exhaustion, thundering herd prevention,

  Phase: 8
  Depends on: RR-0034, RR-0049, RR-0058
  Invariant: 13
  Requirement: `amux` CLI mirroring the bash script. All subcommands: board (add, todo,
    doing, done, type, claim), send, config (show), why, search, schedule, worker
    (create, rename, config, start, stop).
  Tests: `amux board add "test"` creates card, `amux send <worker> "hello"` delivers,

  Phase: 8
  Depends on: RR-0097, RR-0098
  Invariant: 1, 53
  Requirement: New terminology is the DEFAULT for new installations. Existing
    deployments keep working unchanged. API route aliases: /api/workers and
    /api/sessions both resolve to the same handlers; /api/tasks and /api/issues
    likewise. Legacy routes return Deprecated header. Response field aliasing
    controlled by pref `api_field_style` (both/modern/legacy; default: both).
    CLI accepts both `amux worker` and `amux session`, `amux task` and `amux issue`.
    Dashboard display controlled by pref `terminology` (modern/legacy; default:
    modern). SSE events include `legacy_kind` when style != modern.
    No removal timeline for aliases in the Rust rebuild.
  Tests: legacy route returns same response as canonical route + Deprecated header,
    api_field_style=legacy omits new fields, api_field_style=modern omits old fields,
    api_field_style=both includes both, CLI alias resolution, dashboard pref toggle,
    SSE legacy_kind present when configured, legacy_kind mapping table exhaustive

  Invariant: 44
  Requirement: Machine-readable component capabilities registry. DOM crawler discovers
    all data-testid elements across reachable UI states, diffs against registry, fails
    on uncovered controls. CI gate: new data-testid without registered interaction
    contract -> build fails.

  Phase: 8
  Depends on: RR-0023, RR-0024, RR-0025
  Invariant: 35
  Requirement: SSE delivers revisioned StateEvents in rev order. Rev gap triggers
    delta sync. Two tabs mutate same task -> both converge. Kill server, restart ->
    client reconnects and delta-syncs. 1000 rapid board mutations -> UI finishes at

  Invariant: 46
  Requirement: Run UX discovery harness against the complete AMUX dashboard with all
    seed state fixtures. Produce interaction-graph.json, interaction-coverage.json,
    generated-test-plan.md. Generate separate graphs for desktop Chromium and mobile
    viewport + touch. Discover scope/role-specific paths (global, group, worker).
    Report: states discovered, semantic components, interactive controls, semantic
    actions, transition edges, missing semantic IDs.
  Browser verification: discovery report has zero missing semantic IDs

  Status: TODO

- [ ] RR-0107b — UX discovery: offline graph + reconnection paths <!-- open -->
  Phase: 8
  Depends on: RR-0107a, RR-0102
  Invariant: 46
  Requirement: Repeat applicable UX exploration with browser offline. Classify
    discovered actions as: works_offline, queues_offline, read_only_cached,

  Requirement: Commit normalized UX contract/baseline to `tests/ux/contract.json`.
    Generated screenshots/logs are build artifacts. Baseline represents accepted
    reachable UX surface. Updating requires corresponding test changes. Never auto-
    approve changed graph -- discovery detects changes; tests decide correctness.

  Depends on: RR-0017, RR-0019
  Invariant: 32
  Requirement: `GET /api/search?q=...` returns hits across tasks, messages, events,
    logs, workers, schedules, email. SearchHit provenance (entity_type, scope,
    task_id, worker_id, timestamp). FTS5 works completely offline. Search stack:
    exact/filter -> SQLite index -> FTS5 -> optional semantic reranking.
  Tests: cross-entity search, provenance chips, offline FTS5
  Performance: FTS5 over 10k entities returns < 50ms
  Verify: Implementation, Integration tests, API verification, Browser verification,
    Performance, Searchability
  Status: TODO

- [ ] RR-0111 — Structured events + append-only logs <!-- partial 2026-08-09: append-only session_events journal + revisioned StateEvents / missing: correlated human/machine dual views per task -->
  Phase: 9
  Depends on: RR-0009, RR-0108

  Phase: 9
  Depends on: RR-0009, RR-0108, RR-0111
  Invariant: 24, 30
  Requirement: DurableEvent captures enough detail to replay exactly what happened.
    Per-turn capture contract: CommandSent (exact text), TurnStarted (context tokens),
    ModelRequest/ModelResponse (model, tokens, content hashes), ToolUsed (name, args
    hash, result hash, duration), FileWritten (path, content hash, diff hash),
    TurnCompleted (outcome, tokens, duration), plus all state transitions caused.
    EventPayload is either Inline(Value) for small payloads or BlobRef { hash, size,
    store } for large ones (model I/O, file diffs). DurableEvent.causality links
    effect to cause for full decision-tree reconstruction.
    Three replay modes:
    1. Audit replay: read-only, verify events reproduce recorded state transitions
    2. Debug replay: step through worker turn history interactively
    3. Fork replay: replay to event N, diverge with different decision
    Blob retention: configurable window (default 30 days), event rows survive pruning
    with hashes intact but BlobRef resolves to BlobPruned.
    CLI: `amux replay worker <id> --from <event> --to <event>`,
    `amux replay task <id> --mode audit|debug|fork`.
    API: `GET /api/replay/<entity>/<id>?from=&to=&mode=`.

  Tests: all regression tests pass
  Verify: Implementation, Unit tests
  Status: TODO

- [ ] RR-0117d — Spec-to-test traceability infrastructure <!-- open -->
  Phase: 10
  Depends on: RR-0114
  Invariant: 45
  Requirement: Machine-readable mapping: every RR-XXXX -> acceptance test IDs.
    CI validates: (1) every RR item has at least one mapped test (or marked
    documentation-only), (2) every VERIFIED item's tests exist and pass, (3) tests
    referenced by checklist items not deleted/renamed without updating the requirement,
    (4) new user-facing capabilities have acceptance requirements and tests.
    Traceability format:

    tmux, provider-claude, provider-codex, provider-gemini, provider-ollama, migration,
    historical-regression, performance, soak, destructive, production-smoke. CI gates
    select tests by tag. No test logic duplicated to create faster tiers -- same
    scenario/fixture definitions at different scales.
  Tests: tag coverage, gate selection correctness
  Verify: Implementation
  Status: TODO

- [ ] RR-0117g — Performance baseline establishment <!-- open -->
  Phase: 10
  Depends on: RR-0112

    1. Every invariant in this document has at least one test tagged `INV-xxx`.
    2. Every `INV-xxx` tag in code/tests has a matching invariant in this document.
    Violations block merge. The check parses the document's semantic ID table and
    scans code for `INV-` prefixed identifiers.
  Tests: CI script exists, detects missing test for new invariant, detects orphaned tag
  Verify: Implementation
  Status: TODO

- [ ] RR-0117i — Doc-code reconciliation CI check <!-- open -->
  Phase: 10
  Depends on: RR-0117h
  Invariant: 45
  Requirement: For every `INV-xxx` tag in code, the corresponding invariant section
    must not contradict the implementation. Silent disagreement (code does X,
    doc says Y, no amendment recorded) is a CI failure. DocCodeDivergence::Disagreement
    blocks merge.

- [ ] RR-0118 — Migration manifest: all tables with explicit translations <!-- superseded 2026-08-09: shared bilingual DB (strangler design) — Rust serves the live tables in place; additive-only migrations, rehearsal-proven (scripts/migration-rehearsal.sh); no data translation occurs -->
  Phase: 11
  Depends on: RR-0117
  Invariant: 36
  Requirement: One manifest row per source table/entity. Each row documents:
    - Source table name -> destination table name
    - Source column names/types -> destination column names/types (explicit mapping)
    - Transformation logic (renames, type conversions, computed fields, splits, merges)
    - Row count before/after
    - Validation method (row count match, spot-check, hash, full compare)
    - Status: Migrated / Intentionally Transformed / Intentionally Deprecated
    Every source row must be accounted for. Nothing silently disappears. Deprecated
    data has explicit reason and preservation/export path. The manifest is committed
    to the repository as machine-readable JSON/TOML, not just prose.
    Translation examples that must be documented:
    - `sessions` table -> `workers` table (rename + column mapping)
    - Python `status` string values -> Rust `WorkerState` enum variants
    - Python `item_type` strings -> Rust `TaskType` enum variants
    - Python `owner_type` strings -> Rust `OwnerType` enum variants
    - Python epoch timestamps -> Rust `DateTime<Utc>`
    - Python JSON-string columns -> Rust typed structs
    - Python `desc` field -> Rust `desc` + `desc_preview` (computed)

  Invariant: —
  Requirement: Two rollback modes:
    1. Per-route: re-enable proxy for a specific route group, traffic flows to Python.
    2. Full: stop Rust, start Python on 8822. DB compatible in both directions
       (no destructive migrations). Any worker switches herdr -> tmux without data
       migration or identity change.
    Both modes verified with automated tests.
  Tests: per-route rollback tested for board + worker routes, full rollback tested,
    Python serves correctly with same DB
  Verify: Implementation, Integration tests, Persistence/restart
  Status: TODO

  Phase: 11
  Depends on: RR-0117 through RR-0133 (all migration + acceptance items incl. sub-IDs)
  Invariant: 45

NOT verified: the WRITE-side operational loop — board auto-pickup + advance nudges were python-only and were NOT ported (AMUX-2637: the board stopped moving for every worker), and message submission was unverified (AMUX-2629, fixed; 9 of 13 stuck lanes still holding text at last check). Post-cutover verification is not honestly complete until both are green. -->
  Phase: 11
  Depends on: RR-0139

intended end state. The implementation is complete when every requirement has independent
evidence that it works.**

### Checklist reconciliation — 2026-08-09

Reconciled against the code (crates/, e2e/, scripts/, .github/workflows/, docs/rust-migration/).
Every `[x]` above carries a file citation; `partial` names what exists and what is missing.

**Totals (203 items): 96 done · 52 partial · 39 open · 16 superseded.**

**Update — 2026-08-09 late (post-cutover).** RR-0135 and RR-0139 are DONE:
the proxy registry is empty and test-pinned, python is stopped, disabled and
deleted, and rust answers both ports. RR-0154 carries a NAMED DEVIATION —
python was shut down on owner directive before its criteria were met. That is
not a bookkeeping detail: within hours the shutdown surfaced two regressions
those very gates existed to catch, both of which were invisible rather than
loud —
(1) the board→worker drive (auto-pickup + advance/rot nudges) was python-only
and unported, so every worker stopped receiving cards while nothing errored
(AMUX-2637);
(2) message submission was asserted, never verified, so sends landed in an
input box and were reported as delivered (AMUX-2629 — fixed; the ported
`_verify_submitted` now refuses to claim success it cannot evidence).
The honest reading: the MIGRATION is complete, the OPERATIONAL LOOP is not.
RR-0140 stays open until both are green in production, and the remaining
gates (RR-0130/0131 sweeps, RR-0150 restart suite, RR-0152 soak) now run
against a live rust-only fleet rather than a coexisting one — a harder test
than the plan assumed, and the one that matters.
(39 previously checked — all spot-checked sound, none flipped — plus 55 newly verified.)

**(a) Genuinely open, needed before cutover** (AMUX-2598: 8824 exclusively rust + herdr + opencode; runbook docs/rust-migration/cutover-runbook.md):
- RR-0053 — board auto-capture: rust-worker path DONE (runtime.rs:1262); the gap is only python-fleet sessions, which closes itself as sessions become rust workers at cutover
- RR-0135 — proxy removal: retire the four remaining Python families (session verbs, file/library media, browser driver verbs, dictation engine)
- RR-0130 / RR-0131a / RR-0131b / RR-0131d — live-data acceptance sweeps not yet run (messages, logs+events, memories, browser profiles + token ledger)
- RR-0150 — persistent-data restart suite (create -> restart -> reconcile -> verify, all subsystems)
- RR-0152 — 24h soak (runbook Phase B requires 48h monitored stability)
- RR-0139 / RR-0140 — execute the cutover + post-cutover verification
- RR-0154 / RR-0155 — Python shutdown criteria + final release gate

**(b) Open, post-cutover / nice-to-have:**
- RR-0044a per-worker model budgets · RR-0077 correlated task detail · RR-0091 email/calendar e2e · RR-0096 browser/files e2e
- RR-0100/RR-0101 data-testid + interaction registry (extracted SPA has zero data-testid) · RR-0104/RR-0105/RR-0106(partial)/RR-0107 deep-interaction, fault-injection, mobile-geometry, model-based Playwright
- RR-0107a–g UX discovery full-app graph (harness itself shipped in Phase 0)
- RR-0109 `amux why` · RR-0110 universal FTS5 search (net-new; no /api/search exists in Python or the SPA today) · RR-0113 search-bar e2e
- RR-0116/RR-0117a/RR-0117b nightly-deep, release/soak gates + regression thresholds · RR-0117c(partial, 4 of 20+)/RR-0151 incident corpus
- RR-0117d–i traceability, migrated fixture, test tags, perf CI, INV-tag CI checks
- RR-0137 Rust cloud Docker image (deploy-cloud.yml still ships Python only)

**(c) Superseded by decision:**
- RR-0118 through RR-0127 (16 items): the migrate-and-translate plan was replaced by the **shared bilingual DB** strangler design — Rust serves the live tables in place, migrations are additive-only, and `scripts/migration-rehearsal.sh` proves the file stays Python-compatible. No data-translation step exists or is needed.
- CRM: deleted per owner directive (never received an RR item; parity step J confirms the tab stays hidden on both servers).
- RR-0090 was assigned in the spec body but never became a checklist item; its scope (integration registry) shipped inside RR-0073/RR-0088/RR-0089 (integrations/mod.rs).
