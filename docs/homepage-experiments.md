# amux.io Homepage Experiments

**KPIs we optimize for:**
| KPI | PostHog event | Target |
|-----|--------------|--------|
| GitHub stars | `$pageview` → github.com/mixpeek/amux click | ↑ star rate |
| iOS downloads | click on App Store link | ↑ iOS installs |
| Cloud signups | click on concierge/cloud CTA | ↑ onboarding calls |

**Tracking note:** PostHog project key is `phc_Ckeacj8y8X8YiLkwHBcpBsJVSnsFKohch2vMv9sJYmE6` (project 378145 "amux", US cloud, us.i.posthog.com). To query KPI clicks use HogQL on `$autocapture` events filtered by `elements_chain` containing the relevant href. Personal API key needed for API queries — set `POSTHOG_PERSONAL_API_KEY` in ~/.amux/server.env. **Note:** site.js was mistakenly using a personal API key (`phx_`) before 2026-07-09 — no website analytics exist prior to that date.

- **Effort:** S (site.js injection)

### EXP-003 — Homepage hero social proof line
- **Hypothesis:** Adding a concrete social proof line under the lede increases GitHub clicks and concierge signups by anchoring the "288+ developers" stat
- **Page:** `/` (index.html hero)
- **KPI:** GitHub stars + cloud signups
- **Status:** `running`
- **Started:** 2026-07-09
- **Change:** Added `<p class="social-proof">Trusted by 288+ developers shipping overnight with AI agents — open source on GitHub</p>` below the .lede paragraph. Star count is hardcoded to 288 (current as of 2026-07-09). Text links to GitHub repo.
- **Implementation:** Added social-proof paragraph + CSS in index.html
- **Measure after:** 2026-07-16 (7 days minimum)

- **Hypothesis:** Adding scarcity to the concierge CTA ("3 onboarding slots open this month") increases cloud signup clicks by 25%+
- **Page:** `/concierge/` + homepage concierge block
- **KPI:** Cloud signups
- **Status:** `running`
- **Started:** 2026-07-10
- **Implementation:** Added amber urgency badge "3 onboarding slots open this month" above the final CTA in `/concierge/index.html`. Inline SVG clock icon + amber pill styling (`rgba(251,191,36,.12)` background, `#fbbf24` text). No JS — pure CSS badge.
- **Effort:** XS
- **Measure after:** 2026-07-17 (7 days minimum)

### EXP-005 — "Star History" social proof on homepage
- **Hypothesis:** Embedding a star-history chart image on the homepage (showing growth trend) increases GitHub clicks from visitors who aren't sure if the project is active
- **Page:** `/`
- **KPI:** GitHub stars
- **Status:** `running`
- **Started:** 2026-07-11
- **Implementation:** Added star-history.com SVG embed (dark/light via `<picture>`) between features grid and final CTA on homepage. 291 stars caption, GitHub CTA button below the chart. Uses `https://api.star-history.com/svg?repos=mixpeek/amux&type=Date` (dark theme variant via `&theme=dark` in `<source>`). `loading="lazy"` so it doesn't block paint.
- **Effort:** S
- **Measure after:** 2026-07-18 (7 days minimum)

### EXP-013 — GitHub CTA on high-traffic guides
- **Hypothesis:** PostHog shows /guides/best-ai-model-for-coding-2026/ gets 84 pageviews (2nd highest after homepage) but zero KPI clicks. Adding a compact GitHub CTA box at the top of that guide (and other high-traffic guides with no CTA) increases GitHub stars from guide traffic.
- **Page:** /guides/best-ai-model-for-coding-2026/ (first target; then /guides/claude-code-headless/, /guides/ai-coding-finops/)
- **KPI:** GitHub stars
- **Status:** `running`
- **Started:** 2026-07-12
- **Implementation:** Added "Run multiple AI models in parallel from one dashboard → ⭐ Star amux on GitHub" pill CTA below intro paragraph, above Decision Framework table. PostHog event: `exp013_guide_github_cta_click`. Applied to best-ai-model-for-coding-2026/index.html.
- **Effort:** XS per page
- **Measure after:** 2026-07-19 (7 days minimum)

### EXP-006 — GitHub README → iOS CTA
- **Status:** `running`
- **Started:** 2026-07-13
- **Change:** Added official Apple "Download on the App Store" badge image below the shields badges row in README.md, above the concierge CTA. Upgrades from the existing shields.io iOS pill badge to the official Apple App Store badge for more visual prominence.
- **Hypothesis:** A more visually distinctive official App Store badge increases iOS installs from GitHub traffic.
- **KPI:** iOS downloads (App Store link clicks)
- **Measure after:** 2026-07-20 (7 days minimum)

**Upcoming score windows:** EXP-001 → 2026-07-14 · EXP-002 → 2026-07-15 · EXP-003 → 2026-07-16 (all reach 7-day minimum on those dates — query PostHog then).

### EXP-006 — GitHub README → iOS CTA
- **Hypothesis:** Adding an official App Store badge to the README increases iOS installs from GitHub traffic
- **Page:** README.md
- **KPI:** iOS downloads
- **Status:** `running` — started 2026-07-13
- **Implementation:** Added official Apple "Download on the App Store" badge (from tools.applemediaservices.com) below the shields badges `</p>`, above the concierge CTA. More visually prominent than the existing shields.io iOS pill badge.
- **Effort:** XS
- **Measure after:** 2026-07-20

### EXP-007 — Compare pages → GitHub CTA
- **Hypothesis:** Compare pages get high-intent "alternative" traffic. Adding a prominent "Try it free — ⭐ on GitHub" CTA box at the top of each compare page (not just the bottom) increases star clicks from comparison traffic
- **Page:** All `/compare/amux-vs-*/` pages (7 pages: ngrok, codex, cursor, devin, diy-tmux, jules, n8n)
- **KPI:** GitHub stars
- **Status:** `running`
- **Started:** 2026-07-14
- **Implementation:** Added `<!-- EXP-007 -->` GitHub CTA `<div>` block (dark card with "Considering amux? See it in action before deciding →" + "⭐ Star amux on GitHub" button) after the subtitle `<p>` on all 7 compare pages. PostHog event: `exp007_compare_github_cta_click` with `{page: window.location.pathname}`.
- **Effort:** M (7-file edit)
- **Measure after:** 2026-07-21 (7 days minimum)

### EXP-008 — Dark/light mode preference → personalization signal
- **Hypothesis:** Users who switch to light mode are more likely to be non-developers (less terminal-native) and may convert better on concierge/cloud vs GitHub. Track theme preference as a PostHog property.
- **Page:** All pages (site.js)
- **KPI:** Cloud signups (segment)
- **Status:** `running`
- **Started:** 2026-07-15
- **Implementation:** Added `posthog.register({ theme_preference: theme })` in site.js — fires on page load (initial theme) and on every manual toggle. Registers as a super property, so it is attached to all subsequent PostHog events. Can now segment KPI clicks and pageviews by `theme_preference` in HogQL.
- **Effort:** XS
- **Measure after:** 2026-07-22 (7 days minimum)

### EXP-009 — "Indie hackers" and "overnight builders" language in hero subtitle
- **Hypothesis:** Explicitly calling out the indie hacker / overnight builder persona in the homepage hero subtitle increases conversion from that audience (HN, Product Hunt, Indie Hackers forum traffic).
- **Page:** `/` (hero subtitle)
- **KPI:** GitHub stars + concierge signups
- **Status:** `queued`
- **Implementation:** A/B between current subtitle and one that mentions "indie hackers", "solo builders", or "ship overnight"
- **Effort:** XS

### EXP-010 — Feature table reorder: phone-first features at top
- **Hypothesis:** Most visitors who convert on cloud/iOS CTAs are non-enterprise users who are drawn to the phone/mobile angle. Reordering the feature comparison table to lead with "Mobile dashboard (iOS app + PWA)" before "Self-healing watchdog" may increase iOS and cloud CTA clicks.
- **Page:** `/` (feature comparison table)
- **KPI:** iOS downloads + cloud signups
- **Status:** `queued`
- **Implementation:** Reorder table rows in the homepage feature grid
- **Effort:** XS

### EXP-011 — Plan strip / visibility callout in homepage feature list
- **Hypothesis:** The new Plan strip feature (v0.9.44, July 2026) — which lets you see exactly what your Claude Code agent is planning — is a unique differentiator not communicated on the homepage. Adding a one-line callout in the feature list increases clicks from developers frustrated with agent opacity.
- **Page:** `/` (feature grid or "new" badge on relevant feature row)
- **KPI:** GitHub stars (developer audience)
- **Status:** `queued`
- **Implementation:** Add "Plan strip — see your agent's task list in real time (new)" row or badge to homepage feature table
- **Effort:** XS

### EXP-014 — Replicate high-conversion guide pattern on other guides
- **Hypothesis:** /guides/best-ai-agent-multiplexers-2026/ drove 16 GitHub KPI clicks in 7 days — the highest non-homepage conversion rate. PostHog shows this page has unusually high intent. Hypothesis: "best-of" / list-style guide titles convert better than how-to guides because visitors are in evaluation mode. Replicating the page structure (answer-box at top, feature matrix, CTA after matrix) on 3-5 other guides should increase their GitHub click rate from near-zero to 3–8 clicks/week each.
- **Page:** /guides/best-claude-code-session-managers-2026/ (already enriched 2026-07-15), then /guides/best-ai-model-for-coding-2026/, then /guides/running-10-plus-agents/
- **KPI:** GitHub stars
- **Status:** `queued`
- **Implementation:** Audit top-PV guides for missing answer-box + feature matrix. Add EXP-007-style GitHub CTA block to any guide with >20 pageviews/week and <2 KPI clicks/week.
- **Effort:** S (3 files)

### EXP-012 — Freelancer CTA on compare pages
- **Hypothesis:** Compare pages attract high-intent "is this the right tool?" visitors. Adding a "Freelancer? Scale to 5x clients →" contextual CTA on compare pages targets a specific high-converting audience segment identified from the /for/freelancers/ page creation today.
- **Page:** All `/compare/amux-vs-*/` pages (subset test first)
- **KPI:** Concierge signups + /for/freelancers/ traffic
- **Status:** `queued`
- **Implementation:** Add a compact contextual CTA box after the main comparison table linking to /for/freelancers/ and /concierge/
- **Effort:** S (bulk edit Python script)

## Learnings Log

_Updated by SCHED-149 Job 9 after each run with PostHog data and experiment results._

| Date | Finding | Action taken |
|------|---------|--------------|
| 2026-07-07 | PostHog installed, baseline accumulation started | — |
| 2026-07-07 | PostHog HogQL query returned 0 events — no click data yet after 1 day of tracking | EXP-001 shipped; wait for data to accumulate before scoring |
| 2026-07-07 | EXP-001 launched: "View on GitHub" → "⭐ Star on GitHub" on both hero CTAs in homepage | Implement complete; measure 2026-07-14 |
| 2026-07-08 | PostHog still 0 events (Day 1 — accumulating) — EXP-001 cannot be scored yet (< 7 days) | EXP-002 shipped: sticky iOS bottom bar via site.js injection on all pages |
| 2026-07-08 | EXP-002 launched: sticky mobile bottom bar with App Store CTA, PostHog event exp002_ios_sticky_tap | Measure after 2026-07-15; new hypothesis EXP-009 added (indie hacker language) |
| 2026-07-09 | PostHog still accumulating — no KPI click data available after 2 days; EXP-001 and EXP-002 cannot be scored yet | EXP-003 shipped: social proof line "Trusted by 288+ developers" under lede in homepage hero; measure after 2026-07-16 |
| 2026-07-10 | PostHog: 1 day of real data (phc_ key live since 2026-07-09); 294 pageviews, 111 autocaptures recorded — too early to score any experiments (all < 7 days); no KPI click events isolated yet | EXP-004 shipped: amber urgency badge "3 onboarding slots open this month" on /concierge/ final CTA; measure after 2026-07-17 |
| 2026-07-11 | PostHog: 3 days data — 554 pageviews total, 26 KPI clicks (all homepage); /guides/best-ai-model-for-coding-2026/ has 84 PVs but 0 KPI clicks (biggest conversion gap) | EXP-005 shipped: star history chart between features and final CTA; EXP-013 added (guide page GitHub CTA) |
| 2026-07-12 | PostHog: 14-day query returned 0 KPI clicks (data still accumulating — phc_ key only active since 2026-07-09, so < 7 days of real data for all experiments; none scoreable yet) | EXP-013 shipped: GitHub CTA chip on /guides/best-ai-model-for-coding-2026/ (84 PVs, 0 KPI clicks); EXP-006 queued next |
| 2026-07-15 | PostHog 7-day KPI click data: homepage / → 70 clicks (GitHub+AppStore), /guides/best-ai-agent-multiplexers-2026/ → 16 clicks (highest non-homepage conversion rate — outperforming all compare pages), /docs/ → 6, /pricing/ → 6. EXP-002 iOS sticky bar: 5 custom exp002_ios_sticky_tap events observed since launch — positive signal but no pre-experiment baseline available (PostHog only active from 2026-07-09, EXP-002 started 2026-07-08). Cannot score pre/post. Extending measurement to 2026-07-22. EXP-001 also cannot be scored — same baseline gap. | EXP-008 shipped: theme_preference super property registered in site.js on page load and toggle (measures whether dark vs light users convert differently on GitHub vs cloud KPIs). New finding: /guides/best-ai-agent-multiplexers-2026/ has the best GitHub click rate outside the homepage — should investigate what drives this and replicate on similar high-PV guide pages. |

## Notes for SCHED-149

When running Job 9:
1. Query PostHog for click events on `github.com/mixpeek/amux`, `apps.apple.com` links, and `/concierge/` CTAs — these are the three KPI proxies.
2. Check which pages have the highest click-through on each KPI (not just pageviews).
3. Move the highest-confidence `queued` experiment to `running` — implement it (it will be small/XS effort by design in the backlog). Log the start date and expected measurement period (minimum 7 days of traffic).
4. Check any `running` experiments: if ≥7 days of data, read PostHog for pre/post comparison and log result in Concluded section.
5. Add new experiment ideas to the backlog if new patterns emerge from the data (e.g., a page with high traffic but zero KPI clicks is a signal).
6. Always implement the experiment change AND record it — don't just write about it.
