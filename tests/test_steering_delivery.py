"""Deterministic test of steering delivery semantics (settle window, waiting-hold,
subagent-hold, one-per-boundary FIFO, guard folding, commit-nudge revalidation).
Loads the REAL _steer_try_deliver from amux-server.py via AST — no server needed.

Loads the REAL _steer_try_deliver out of amux-server.py via AST and drives it
with a fake monotonic clock + stubbed send/db, proving:
  - a lone idle frame does NOT deliver (only starts the settle timer)
  - continuous idle for >= _STEER_SETTLE_SECS DOES deliver, exactly once
  - an 'active' frame mid-settle RESETS the window (no premature delivery)
  - 'waiting' settles the same way as 'idle'
  - an in-flight background subagent HOLDS steering even at an idle main loop
